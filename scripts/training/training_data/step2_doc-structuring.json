        "input": "In gastronomy, red meat is commonly red when raw and a dark color after it is cooked, in contrast to white meat, which is pale in color before and after cooking. In culinary terms, only flesh from mammals or fowl (not fish) is classified as red or white. In nutritional science, on the other hand, \"red meat\" is defined as any meat that has more of the protein myoglobin than white meat. White meat is defined as non-dark meat from fish or chicken (excluding the leg or thigh). Some meat, such as pork, is classified as \"white meat\" under the common or gastronomic definition, but as \"red meat\" under the nutritional definition. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), all meats obtained from mammals (regardless of cut or age) are red meats because they contain more myoglobin than fish or white meat (but not necessarily dark meat) from chicken. Under the culinary definition, the meat from adult or \"gamey\" mammals (for example, beef, horse meat, mutton, venison, boar, hare) is red meat, while that from young mammals (rabbit, veal, lamb) is white. Most poultry is white, but duck and goose are red. Most cuts of pork are red, others are white. Game is sometimes put in a separate category altogether. (French: \"viandes noires\" \u2014 \"dark meats\".) Some meats (lamb, pork) are classified differently by different writers. Some cuts of pork are considered white under the culinary definition, but all pork is red in nutritional studies. The National Pork Board has positioned it as \"the other white meat\", profiting from the ambiguity to suggest that pork has the nutritional properties of white meat, which is considered more healthful. Socially, it is popularly accepted that meat is a symbol of satiety and success (wealth) by people across the world. Across many cultures, it is traditional to eat meat with loved ones for gatherings or celebrations. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, red meat is defined as \"something substantial that can satisfy a basic need or appetite.\" Consumption in the United States continues to grow. Red meat contains large amounts of iron, creatine, minerals such as zinc and phosphorus, and B-vitamins: (niacin, vitamin B, thiamin and riboflavin). Red meat is a source of lipoic acid. Red meat contains small amounts of vitamin D. The liver contains much higher quantities than other parts of the animal. In 2011, the USDA launched MyPlate, which did not distinguish between kinds of meat, but did recommend eating at least 8 oz (227 grams) of fish each week. In 2011, the Harvard School of Public Health launched the Healthy Eating Plate in part because of the perceived inadequacies of the USDA's recommendations. The Healthy Eating Plate encourages consumers to avoid processed meat and limit red meat consumption to twice a week because of links to heart disease, diabetes, and colon cancer. To replace these meats it recommends consuming fish, poultry, beans or nuts. Understanding the health impact of red meat is difficult because it is not a uniform product, with effects varying based on fat content, processing and preparation. Processed red meat, in particular, is linked to higher mortality, mainly due to cardiovascular diseases and cancer. There is some epidemiological association which indicates that the consumption of unprocessed red meat may have negative health effects in humans, however this is being contested. The association of red meat with increased mortality may also be increased with certain cooking methods. There appears to be a positive correlation between the consumption of processed red meat and several kinds of cancer. These include lung, esophageal, liver, and colon cancer. Conversely, an inverse association has been found with a few rare cancer types as well. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified processed meat (e.g., bacon, ham, hot dogs, sausages) as, \"\"carcinogenic to humans\" (Group 1), based on \"sufficient evidence\" in humans that the consumption of processed meat causes colorectal cancer.\" IARC also classified red meat as \"\"probably carcinogenic to humans\" (Group 2A), based on \"limited evidence\" that the consumption of red meat causes cancer in humans and \"strong\" mechanistic evidence supporting a carcinogenic effect.\" Subsequent studies have shown that taxing processed meat products could save lives, particularly in the West where meat intensive diets are the norm. If the amount of taxation was linked to the level of harm they caused, some processed meats, such as bacon and sausages, would nearly double in price. A cohort study suggested that risk of pancreatic cancer is statistically associated with intake of red meat. An even stronger association was found for processed meat intake. That authors also noted that \"future analyses of meat and pancreatic cancer risk should focus on meat preparation methods and related carcinogens.\" Animal fat, particularly from ruminants, tends to have a higher percentage of saturated fat vs. monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fat when compared to most vegetable fats. The saturated fat found in meat has been associated with significantly raised risks of colon cancer, although evidence suggests that risks of prostate cancer are unrelated to animal fat consumption. Other research does not support significant links between meat consumption and various cancers. A meta-analysis of prospective studies found that \"There were no significant differences between vegetarians and nonvegetarians in mortality from cerebrovascular disease, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer or all other causes combined.\" Truswell reviewed numerous studies, concluding that the relationship of colorectal cancer with meat consumption appeared weaker than the \"probable\" status it had been given by the World Cancer Research Foundation in 1997. A study by Chao et al. (2005) found an apparent association of colorectal cancer with red meat consumption after adjustment for age and energy intake. However, after further adjustment for body mass index, cigarette smoking and other covariates, no association with red meat consumption was found. A meta-analysis found no association of colorectal cancer with consumption of animal fat or protein. The EPIC-Oxford study found a lower rate of colorectal cancer amount red meat eaters. A study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) found that association between esophageal cancer risk and total and processed meat intake was not statistically significant. The relation of red meat with cardiovascular disease is complex, with understanding still evolving. Consumption of red meat does not appear to be associated with cardiovascular disease risk factors like total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, ratio of TC to HDL and blood pressure. Red meat consumption has been linked to inflammatory markers in the blood in women, but most of this association appears to disappear when data is adjusted for the average increased body weight of meat eaters. It is, however, associated with higher fasting glucose and insulin concentrations. Prospective cohort studies have found an association with increased cardiovascular mortality. Replacing red meat with fish leads to reduced atherosclerosis and vascular occlusion, though there is no impact on rates of total ischemic strokes. Processed red meat intake was associated with hiher risk than intake of unprocessed red meat, and poultry was found healthier than fish. Replacing unprocessed red meat with poultry in Asian men is associated with reduced cardiovascular disease. Increased unprocessed red meat consumption is associated with a decreased risk of demyelinating neurologic disease. The consensus on the role of red meat consumption to increased risk of cardiovascular diseases has changed in recent years. Studies that differentiate between processed and fresh red meat have failed to find a link between unprocessed red meat consumption and heart disease. A meta-analysis published in 2010 involving around one million people who ate meat found that only processed meat had an adverse risk in relation to coronary heart disease (CHD). The review suggested that the \"differences in salt and preservatives, rather than fats, might explain the higher risk of heart disease and diabetes seen with processed meats, but not with unprocessed red meats.\" Some mechanisms that have been suggested for why red meat consumption might be risk factor for cardiovascular disease include: its impact on serum cholesterol, that red meat contains arachidonic acid, heme iron, homocysteine, and its high saturated fat content. Several studies have found a correlation between unprocessed red meat and the occurrence of CHD and certain types of stroke and have controlled for various confounding risk factors. A study of 84,000 women, over a period of 26 years, finds that those with the highest intake of unprocessed red meat, have a 13% increased risk of CHD. Likewise a Harvard study published in 2012, studying mortality as a result of processed and unprocessed red meat consumption finds that one serving (\u2248 42 g/day) of unprocessed meat a day results in an increased risk of mortality of 13%, and likewise, processed meat 20%. While these ratios are indicative of cancer and cardiovascular (CVD) disease, the study indicates that of the 23,926 deaths investigated during the course of the study, 5910 of them were related to CVD and there was no statistical significance between the risk of unprocessed and processed red meats factors in the occurrence of CVD. The disparity between metadata studies definitely need to be addressed, because while one points toward unprocessed red meat being insignificant in certain health risks, there are still correlations to be found in focused large cohort studies. Unprocessed red meat intake is tentatively associated with an increased risk of type II diabetes, but the link is weaker and less certain than the link between processed red meat and diabetes. Other findings have suggested that the association may be due to saturated fat, trans fat and dietary cholesterol, rather than red meat per se. One study estimated that \u201csubstitutions of one serving of nuts, low-fat dairy, and whole grains per day for one serving of red meat per day were associated with a 16\u201335% lower risk of type 2 diabetes\u201d. A 2012 meta-analysis found an increased risk of gastric cancer with higher consumption of red or processed meat. Red meat itself contains certain factors that, under certain conditions, produce carcinogens like N-nitroso compounds (NOCs). In 2015 the International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded that red meat is probably (Group 2A) carcinogenic to humans, and reported that for each additional 100g (up to a maximum of approximately 140g) of red meat consumed per day, the risk of colorectal cancer increased by 17%; there also appeared to be increased risk of pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer but the association was not as clear. Put in perspective, in the UK, 56 out of 1000 people who eat the lowest amount of red meat will develop colorectal cancer (5.6%) while 66 out of 1000 high-red meat eaters will develop colorectal cancer (6.6%) (1.17 x 5.6 = 6.6). A 2016 literature review reported that for 100g or more per day of red meat consumed, the risk increased 11% for each of stroke and for breast cancer, 15% for cardiovascular mortality, 17% for colorectal cancer, and 19% for advanced prostate cancer. Most processed meat contains at least some red meat. To enhance flavor or improve preservation meat is treated by salting, curing, fermentation, smoking, or other processes to create processed meat. Nitrates and nitrites found in processed meat (e.g. bacon, ham, salami, pepperoni, hot dogs, and some sausages) can be converted by the human body into nitrosamines that can be carcinogenic, causing mutation in the colorectal cell line, thereby causing tumorigenesis and eventually leading to cancer. In its Press Release 240 (16 Oct. 2015) the International Agency for Research on Cancer, based on a review of 800 studies over 20 years, concluded that processed meat is definitely carcinogenic (Group 1) and found that for each additional 50g of processed meat consumed per day, the risk of colorectal cancer increased by 18% (up to a maximum of approximately 140g); it also found that there appeared to be an increase in gastric cancer but this was not as clear. A 2016 literature review found that for the each additional 50g per day of processed meat (e.g., bacon, ham, hot dogs, sausages) consumed, the risk increased 4% for total prostate cancer, 8% for cancer mortality, 9% for breast cancer, 18% for colorectal cancer, 19% for pancreatic cancer, 13% for stroke, 24% for cardiovascular mortality and 32% for diabetes. Cooking any meat at a high temperature or smoking meat produces carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds (PAHs) and heterocyclic amines (HCAs). The subgroups of heterocyclic amines compounds are amino-dimethylimidazo-quinoxaline (MelQx), amino-dimethylimidazo-quinoxaline (DiMelQx), and amino-methyl-phenylimidazo-pyridine (PhIP), which are mostly formed when meat is cooked at high temperatures. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is another compound found in meat cooked at extremely high temperatures. Likely because of these factors, marinating fresh lean red meat and thoroughly cooking it at a low temperature will reduce the production of carcinogenic compounds and thereby lower the risk of colorectal cancer.",

        "input": "Technology (\"science of craft\", from Greek , \"techne\", \"art, skill, cunning of hand\"; and , \"-logia\") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. Systems (e. g. machines) applying technology by taking an input, changing it according to the system's use, and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems. The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. Technology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today's global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth's environment. Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions in the ethics of technology. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics. Philosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition. The use of the term \"technology\" has changed significantly over the last 200 years. Before the 20th century, the term was uncommon in English, and it was used either to refer to the description or study of the useful arts or to allude to technical education, as in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (chartered in 1861). The term \"technology\" rose to prominence in the 20th century in connection with the Second Industrial Revolution. The term's meanings changed in the early 20th century when American social scientists, beginning with Thorstein Veblen, translated ideas from the German concept of \"\" into \"technology.\" In German and other European languages, a distinction exists between \"technik\" and \"technologie\" that is absent in English, which usually translates both terms as \"technology.\" By the 1930s, \"technology\" referred not only to the study of the industrial arts but to the industrial arts themselves. In 1937, the American sociologist Read Bain wrote that \"technology includes all tools, machines, utensils, weapons, instruments, housing, clothing, communicating and transporting devices and the skills by which we produce and use them.\" Bain's definition remains common among scholars today, especially social scientists. Scientists and engineers usually prefer to define technology as applied science, rather than as the things that people make and use. More recently, scholars have borrowed from European philosophers of \"technique\" to extend the meaning of technology to various forms of instrumental reason, as in Foucault's work on technologies of the self (\"techniques de soi\"). Dictionaries and scholars have offered a variety of definitions. The \"Merriam-Webster Learner's Dictionary\" offers a definition of the term: \"the use of science in industry, engineering, etc., to invent useful things or to solve problems\" and \"a machine, piece of equipment, method, etc., that is created by technology.\" Ursula Franklin, in her 1989 \"Real World of Technology\" lecture, gave another definition of the concept; it is \"practice, the way we do things around here.\" The term is often used to imply a specific field of technology, or to refer to high technology or just consumer electronics, rather than technology as a whole. Bernard Stiegler, in \"Technics and Time, 1\", defines technology in two ways: as \"the pursuit of life by means other than life,\" and as \"organized inorganic matter.\" Technology can be most broadly defined as the entities, both material and immaterial, created by the application of mental and physical effort in order to achieve some value. In this usage, technology refers to tools and machines that may be used to solve real-world problems. It is a far-reaching term that may include simple tools, such as a crowbar or wooden spoon, or more complex machines, such as a space station or particle accelerator. Tools and machines need not be material; virtual technology, such as computer software and business methods, fall under this definition of technology. W. Brian Arthur defines technology in a similarly broad way as \"a means to fulfill a human purpose.\" The word \"technology\" can also be used to refer to a collection of techniques. In this context, it is the current state of humanity's knowledge of how to combine resources to produce desired products, to solve problems, fulfill needs, or satisfy wants; it includes technical methods, skills, processes, techniques, tools and raw materials. When combined with another term, such as \"medical technology\" or \"space technology,\" it refers to the state of the respective field's knowledge and tools. \"State-of-the-art technology\" refers to the high technology available to humanity in any field. Technology can be viewed as an activity that forms or changes culture. Additionally, technology is the application of math, science, and the arts for the benefit of life as it is known. A modern example is the rise of communication technology, which has lessened barriers to human interaction and as a result has helped spawn new subcultures; the rise of cyberculture has at its basis the development of the Internet and the computer. Not all technology enhances culture in a creative way; technology can also help facilitate political oppression and war via tools such as guns. As a cultural activity, technology predates both science and engineering, each of which formalize some aspects of technological endeavor. The distinction between science, engineering, and technology is not always clear. Science is systematic knowledge of the physical or material world gained through observation and experimentation. Technologies are not usually exclusively products of science, because they have to satisfy requirements such as utility, usability, and safety. Engineering is the goal-oriented process of designing and making tools and systems to exploit natural phenomena for practical human means, often (but not always) using results and techniques from science. The development of technology may draw upon many fields of knowledge, including scientific, engineering, mathematical, linguistic, and historical knowledge, to achieve some practical result. Technology is often a consequence of science and engineering, although technology as a human activity precedes the two fields. For example, science might study the flow of electrons in electrical conductors by using already-existing tools and knowledge. This new-found knowledge may then be used by engineers to create new tools and machines such as semiconductors, computers, and other forms of advanced technology. In this sense, scientists and engineers may both be considered technologists; the three fields are often considered as one for the purposes of research and reference. The exact relations between science and technology in particular have been debated by scientists, historians, and policymakers in the late 20th century, in part because the debate can inform the funding of basic and applied science. In the immediate wake of World War II, for example, it was widely considered in the United States that technology was simply \"applied science\" and that to fund basic science was to reap technological results in due time. An articulation of this philosophy could be found explicitly in Vannevar Bush's treatise on postwar science policy, \"Science \u2013 The Endless Frontier\": \"New products, new industries, and more jobs require continuous additions to knowledge of the laws of nature\u00a0... This essential new knowledge can be obtained only through basic scientific research.\" In the late-1960s, however, this view came under direct attack, leading towards initiatives to fund science for specific tasks (initiatives resisted by the scientific community). The issue remains contentious, though most analysts resist the model that technology simply is a result of scientific research. The use of tools by early humans was partly a process of discovery and of evolution. Early humans evolved from a species of foraging hominids which were already bipedal, with a brain mass approximately one third of modern humans. Tool use remained relatively unchanged for most of early human history. Approximately 50,000 years ago, the use of tools and complex set of behaviors emerged, believed by many archaeologists to be connected to the emergence of fully modern language. Hominids started using primitive stone tools millions of years ago. The earliest stone tools were little more than a fractured rock, but approximately 75,000 years ago, pressure flaking provided a way to make much finer work. The discovery and utilization of fire, a simple energy source with many profound uses, was a turning point in the technological evolution of humankind. The exact date of its discovery is not known; evidence of burnt animal bones at the Cradle of Humankind suggests that the domestication of fire occurred before 1 Ma; scholarly consensus indicates that \"Homo erectus\" had controlled fire by between 500 and 400 ka. Fire, fueled with wood and charcoal, allowed early humans to cook their food to increase its digestibility, improving its nutrient value and broadening the number of foods that could be eaten. Other technological advances made during the Paleolithic era were clothing and shelter; the adoption of both technologies cannot be dated exactly, but they were a key to humanity's progress. As the Paleolithic era progressed, dwellings became more sophisticated and more elaborate; as early as 380 ka, humans were constructing temporary wood huts. Clothing, adapted from the fur and hides of hunted animals, helped humanity expand into colder regions; humans began to migrate out of Africa by 200 ka and into other continents such as Eurasia. Human's technological ascent began in earnest in what is known as the Neolithic Period (\"New Stone Age\"). The invention of polished stone axes was a major advance that allowed forest clearance on a large scale to create farms. This use of polished stone axes increased greatly in the Neolithic, but were originally used in the preceding Mesolithic in some areas such as Ireland. Agriculture fed larger populations, and the transition to sedentism allowed simultaneously raising more children, as infants no longer needed to be carried, as nomadic ones must. Additionally, children could contribute labor to the raising of crops more readily than they could to the hunter-gatherer economy. With this increase in population and availability of labor came an increase in labor specialization. What triggered the progression from early Neolithic villages to the first cities, such as Uruk, and the first civilizations, such as Sumer, is not specifically known; however, the emergence of increasingly hierarchical social structures and specialized labor, of trade and war amongst adjacent cultures, and the need for collective action to overcome environmental challenges such as irrigation, are all thought to have played a role. Continuing improvements led to the furnace and bellows and provided, for the first time, the ability to smelt and forge of gold, copper, silver, and lead native metals found in relatively pure form in nature. The advantages of copper tools over stone, bone, and wooden tools were quickly apparent to early humans, and native copper was probably used from near the beginning of Neolithic times (about 10 ka). Native copper does not naturally occur in large amounts, but copper ores are quite common and some of them produce metal easily when burned in wood or charcoal fires. Eventually, the working of metals led to the discovery of alloys such as bronze and brass (about 4000 BCE). The first uses of iron alloys such as steel dates to around 1800 BCE. Meanwhile, humans were learning to harness other forms of energy. The earliest known use of wind power is the sailing ship; the earliest record of a ship under sail is that of a Nile boat dating to the 8th millennium BCE. From prehistoric times, Egyptians probably used the power of the annual flooding of the Nile to irrigate their lands, gradually learning to regulate much of it through purposely built irrigation channels and \"catch\" basins. The ancient Sumerians in Mesopotamia used a complex system of canals and levees to divert water from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers for irrigation. According to archaeologists, the wheel was invented around 4000 BCE probably independently and nearly simultaneously in Mesopotamia (in present-day Iraq), the Northern Caucasus (Maykop culture) and Central Europe. Estimates on when this may have occurred range from 5500 to 3000 BCE with most experts putting it closer to 4000 BCE. The oldest artifacts with drawings depicting wheeled carts date from about 3500 BCE; however, the wheel may have been in use for millennia before these drawings were made. More recently, the oldest-known wooden wheel in the world was found in the Ljubljana marshes of Slovenia. The invention of the wheel revolutionized trade and war. It did not take long to discover that wheeled wagons could be used to carry heavy loads. The ancient Sumerians used the potter's wheel and may have invented it. A stone pottery wheel found in the city-state of Ur dates to around 3429 BCE, and even older fragments of wheel-thrown pottery have been found in the same area. Fast (rotary) potters' wheels enabled early mass production of pottery, but it was the use of the wheel as a transformer of energy (through water wheels, windmills, and even treadmills) that revolutionized the application of nonhuman power sources. The first two-wheeled carts were derived from travois and were first used in Mesopotamia and Iran in around 3000 BCE. The oldest known constructed roadways are the stone-paved streets of the city-state of Ur, dating to circa 4000 BCE and timber roads leading through the swamps of Glastonbury, England, dating to around the same time period. The first long-distance road, which came into use around 3500 BCE, spanned 1,500 miles from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea, but was not paved and was only partially maintained. In around 2000 BCE, the Minoans on the Greek island of Crete built a fifty-kilometer (thirty-mile) road leading from the palace of Gortyn on the south side of the island, through the mountains, to the palace of Knossos on the north side of the island. Unlike the earlier road, the Minoan road was completely paved. Ancient Minoan private homes had running water. A bathtub virtually identical to modern ones was unearthed at the Palace of Knossos. Several Minoan private homes also had toilets, which could be flushed by pouring water down the drain. The ancient Romans had many public flush toilets, which emptied into an extensive sewage system. The primary sewer in Rome was the Cloaca Maxima; construction began on it in the sixth century BCE and it is still in use today. The ancient Romans also had a complex system of aqueducts, which were used to transport water across long distances. The first Roman aqueduct was built in 312 BCE. The eleventh and final ancient Roman aqueduct was built in 226 CE. Put together, the Roman aqueducts extended over 450 kilometers, but less than seventy kilometers of this was above ground and supported by arches. Innovations continued through the Middle Ages with innovations such as silk, the horse collar and horseshoes in the first few hundred years after the fall of the Roman Empire. Medieval technology saw the use of simple machines (such as the lever, the screw, and the pulley) being combined to form more complicated tools, such as the wheelbarrow, windmills and clocks. The Renaissance brought forth many of these innovations, including the printing press (which facilitated the greater communication of knowledge), and technology became increasingly associated with science, beginning a cycle of mutual advancement. The advancements in technology in this era allowed a more steady supply of food, followed by the wider availability of consumer goods. Starting in the United Kingdom in the 18th century, the Industrial Revolution was a period of great technological discovery, particularly in the areas of agriculture, manufacturing, mining, metallurgy, and transport, driven by the discovery of steam power. Technology took another step in a second industrial revolution with the harnessing of electricity to create such innovations as the electric motor, light bulb, and countless others. Scientific advancement and the discovery of new concepts later allowed for powered flight and advancements in medicine, chemistry, physics, and engineering. The rise in technology has led to skyscrapers and broad urban areas whose inhabitants rely on motors to transport them and their food supply. Communication was also greatly improved with the invention of the telegraph, telephone, radio and television. The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a revolution in transportation with the invention of the airplane and automobile. The 20th century brought a host of innovations. In physics, the discovery of nuclear fission has led to both nuclear weapons and nuclear power. Computers were also invented and later miniaturized utilizing transistors and integrated circuits. Information technology subsequently led to the creation of the Internet, which ushered in the current Information Age. Humans have also been able to explore space with satellites (later used for telecommunication) and in manned missions going all the way to the moon. In medicine, this era brought innovations such as open-heart surgery and later stem cell therapy along with new medications and treatments. Complex manufacturing and construction techniques and organizations are needed to make and maintain these new technologies, and entire industries have arisen to support and develop succeeding generations of increasingly more complex tools. Modern technology increasingly relies on training and education\u00a0\u2013 their designers, builders, maintainers, and users often require sophisticated general and specific training. Moreover, these technologies have become so complex that entire fields have been created to support them, including engineering, medicine, and computer science, and other fields have been made more complex, such as construction, transportation, and architecture. Generally, technicism is the belief in the utility of technology for improving human societies. Taken to an extreme, technicism \"reflects a fundamental attitude which seeks to control reality, to resolve all problems with the use of scientific\u2013technological methods and tools.\" In other words, human beings will someday be able to master all problems and possibly even control the future using technology. Some, such as Stephen V. Monsma, connect these ideas to the abdication of religion as a higher moral authority. Optimistic assumptions are made by proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and singularitarianism, which view technological development as generally having beneficial effects for the society and the human condition. In these ideologies, technological development is morally good. Transhumanists generally believe that the point of technology is to overcome barriers, and that what we commonly refer to as the human condition is just another barrier to be surpassed. Singularitarians believe in some sort of \"accelerating change\"; that the rate of technological progress accelerates as we obtain more technology, and that this will culminate in a \"Singularity\" after artificial general intelligence is invented in which progress is nearly infinite; hence the term. Estimates for the date of this Singularity vary, but prominent futurist Ray Kurzweil estimates the Singularity will occur in 2045. Kurzweil is also known for his history of the universe in six epochs: (1) the physical/chemical epoch, (2) the life epoch, (3) the human/brain epoch, (4) the technology epoch, (5) the artificial intelligence epoch, and (6) the universal colonization epoch. Going from one epoch to the next is a Singularity in its own right, and a period of speeding up precedes it. Each epoch takes a shorter time, which means the whole history of the universe is one giant Singularity event. Some critics see these ideologies as examples of scientism and techno-utopianism and fear the notion of human enhancement and technological singularity which they support. Some have described Karl Marx as a techno-optimist. On the somewhat skeptical side are certain philosophers like Herbert Marcuse and John Zerzan, who believe that technological societies are inherently flawed. They suggest that the inevitable result of such a society is to become evermore technological at the cost of freedom and psychological health. Many, such as the Luddites and prominent philosopher Martin Heidegger, hold serious, although not entirely, deterministic reservations about technology (see \"The Question Concerning Technology\"). According to Heidegger scholars Hubert Dreyfus and Charles Spinosa, \"Heidegger does not oppose technology. He hopes to reveal the essence of technology in a way that 'in no way confines us to a stultified compulsion to push on blindly with technology or, what comes to the same thing, to rebel helplessly against it.' Indeed, he promises that 'when we once open ourselves expressly to the essence of technology, we find ourselves unexpectedly taken into a freeing claim.' What this entails is a more complex relationship to technology than either techno-optimists or techno-pessimists tend to allow.\" Some of the most poignant criticisms of technology are found in what are now considered to be dystopian literary classics such as Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\", Anthony Burgess's \"A Clockwork Orange\", and George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\". In Goethe's \"Faust\", Faust selling his soul to the devil in return for power over the physical world is also often interpreted as a metaphor for the adoption of industrial technology. More recently, modern works of science fiction such as those by Philip K. Dick and William Gibson and films such as \"Blade Runner\" and \"Ghost in the Shell\" project highly ambivalent or cautionary attitudes toward technology's impact on human society and identity. The late cultural critic Neil Postman distinguished tool-using societies from technological societies and from what he called \"technopolies,\" societies that are dominated by the ideology of technological and scientific progress to the exclusion or harm of other cultural practices, values, and world-views. Darin Barney has written about technology's impact on practices of citizenship and democratic culture, suggesting that technology can be construed as (1) an object of political debate, (2) a means or medium of discussion, and (3) a setting for democratic deliberation and citizenship. As a setting for democratic culture, Barney suggests that technology tends to make ethical questions, including the question of what a good life consists in, nearly impossible because they already give an answer to the question: a good life is one that includes the use of more and more technology. Nikolas Kompridis has also written about the dangers of new technology, such as genetic engineering, nanotechnology, synthetic biology, and robotics. He warns that these technologies introduce unprecedented new challenges to human beings, including the possibility of the permanent alteration of our biological nature. These concerns are shared by other philosophers, scientists and public intellectuals who have written about similar issues (e.g. Francis Fukuyama, J\u00fcrgen Habermas, William Joy, and Michael Sandel). Another prominent critic of technology is Hubert Dreyfus, who has published books such as \"On the Internet\" and \"What Computers Still Can't Do\". A more infamous anti-technological treatise is \"\", written by the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski and printed in several major newspapers (and later books) as part of an effort to end his bombing campaign of the techno-industrial infrastructure. There are also subcultures that disapprove of some or most technology, such as self-identified off-gridders. The notion of appropriate technology was developed in the 20th century by thinkers such as E.F. Schumacher and Jacques Ellul to describe situations where it was not desirable to use very new technologies or those that required access to some centralized infrastructure or parts or skills imported from elsewhere. The ecovillage movement emerged in part due to this concern. \"This section mainly focuses on American concerns even if it can reasonably be generalized to other Western countries. \" In his article, Jared Bernstein, a Senior Fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, questions the widespread idea that automation, and more broadly, technological advances, have mainly contributed to this growing labor market problem. His thesis appears to be a third way between optimism and skepticism. Essentially, he stands for a neutral approach of the linkage between technology and American issues concerning unemployment and declining wages. He uses two main arguments to defend his point. First, because of recent technological advances, an increasing number of workers are losing their jobs. Yet, scientific evidence fails to clearly demonstrate that technology has displaced so many workers that it has created more problems than it has solved. Indeed, automation threatens repetitive jobs but higher-end jobs are still necessary because they complement technology and manual jobs that \"requires flexibility judgment and common sense\" remain hard to replace with machines. Second, studies have not shown clear links between recent technology advances and the wage trends of the last decades. Therefore, according to Bernstein, instead of focusing on technology and its hypothetical influences on current American increasing unemployment and declining wages, one needs to worry more about \"bad policy that fails to offset the imbalances in demand, trade, income, and opportunity.\" For people who use both the Internet and mobile devices in excessive quantities it is likely for them to experience fatigue and over exhaustion as a result of disruptions in their sleeping patterns. Continuous studies have shown that increased BMI and weight gain are associated with people who spend long hours online and not exercising frequently. Heavy Internet use is also displayed in the school lower grades of those who use it in excessive amounts. It has also been noted that the use of mobile phones whilst driving has increased the occurrence of road accidents \u2014 particularly amongst teen drivers. Statistically, teens reportedly have fourfold the number of road traffic incidents as those who are 20 years or older, and a very high percentage of adolescents write (81%) and read (92%) texts while driving. In this context, mass media and technology have a negative impact on people, on both their mental and physical health. Thomas P. Hughes stated that because technology has been considered as a key way to solve problems, we need to be aware of its complex and varied characters to use it more efficiently. What is the difference between a wheel or a compass and cooking machines such as an oven or a gas stove? Can we consider all of them, only a part of them, or none of them as technologies? Technology is often considered too narrowly; according to Hughes, \"Technology is a creative process involving human ingenuity\". This definition's emphasis on creativity avoids unbounded definitions that may mistakenly include cooking \"technologies,\" but it also highlights the prominent role of humans and therefore their responsibilities for the use of complex technological systems. Yet, because technology is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies, Hughes argues that engineers, scientists, and managers have often believed that they can use technology to shape the world as they want. They have often supposed that technology is easily controllable and this assumption has to be thoroughly questioned. For instance, Evgeny Morozov particularly challenges two concepts: \"Internet-centrism\" and \"solutionism.\" Internet-centrism refers to the idea that our society is convinced that the Internet is one of the most stable and coherent forces. Solutionism is the ideology that every social issue can be solved thanks to technology and especially thanks to the internet. In fact, technology intrinsically contains uncertainties and limitations. According to Alexis Madrigal's review of Morozov's theory, to ignore it will lead to \"unexpected consequences that could eventually cause more damage than the problems they seek to address.\" Benjamin R. Cohen and Gwen Ottinger also discussed the multivalent effects of technology. Therefore, recognition of the limitations of technology, and more broadly, scientific knowledge, is needed\u00a0\u2013 especially in cases dealing with environmental justice and health issues. Ottinger continues this reasoning and argues that the ongoing recognition of the limitations of scientific knowledge goes hand in hand with scientists and engineers\u2019 new comprehension of their role. Such an approach of technology and science \"[require] technical professionals to conceive of their roles in the process differently. [They have to consider themselves as] collaborators in research and problem solving rather than simply providers of information and technical solutions.\" Technology is properly defined as any application of science to accomplish a function. The science can be leading edge or well established and the function can have high visibility or be significantly more mundane, but it is all technology, and its exploitation is the foundation of all competitive advantage. Technology-based planning is what was used to build the US industrial giants before WWII (e.g., Dow, DuPont, GM) and it is what was used to transform the US into a superpower. It was not economic-based planning. The use of basic technology is also a feature of other animal species apart from humans. These include primates such as chimpanzees, some dolphin communities, and crows. Considering a more generic perspective of technology as ethology of active environmental conditioning and control, we can also refer to animal examples such as beavers and their dams, or bees and their honeycombs. The ability to make and use tools was once considered a defining characteristic of the genus Homo. However, the discovery of tool construction among chimpanzees and related primates has discarded the notion of the use of technology as unique to humans. For example, researchers have observed wild chimpanzees utilising tools for foraging: some of the tools used include leaf sponges, termite fishing probes, pestles and levers. West African chimpanzees also use stone hammers and anvils for cracking nuts, as do capuchin monkeys of Boa Vista, Brazil. Theories of technology often attempt to predict the future of technology based on the high technology and science of the time. As with all predictions of the future, however, technology's is uncertain. In 2005, futurist Ray Kurzweil predicted that the future of technology would mainly consist of an overlapping \"GNR Revolution\" of genetics, nanotechnology and robotics, with robotics being the most important of the three.",

        "instruction": "Divide the following long text into well-structured, appropriately sized chapters.",
        "input": "The Architecture of Switzerland was influenced by its location astride major trade routes, along with diverse architectural traditions of the four national languages. Romans and later Italians brought their monumental and vernacular architecture north over the Alps, meeting the Germanic and German styles coming south and French influences coming east. Additionally Swiss mercenary service brought architectural elements from other lands back to Switzerland. All the major styles including Roman, Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Neoclassical, Art Nouveau, Modern architecture and Post Modern are well represented throughout the country. The founding of the Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne in La Sarraz, Switzerland and the work of Swiss-born Modern architects such as Le Corbusier helped spread Modern architecture throughout the world. The relative isolation of villages in the Alpine foothills, the Alps and the Jura mountains as well as different languages led to great diversity in the vernacular style. Due to differing traditions, climate and building materials villages in each region are distinctly different. The Swiss chalet style which was popular in the 19th century represents only one of a number of traditional designs. Today due to historic preservation laws and tourism many large and small communities have retained many of their historic core buildings. Since 1972 the Swiss Heritage Society has awarded the Wakker Prize to encourage communities to preserve their architectural heritage. Some of the earliest known buildings in Switzerland were prehistoric stilt houses which were built by the Pfyn, Horgen, Cortaillod and La T\u00e8ne cultures between 4000 and 500 BC. A number of these early buildings have been rebuilt near the sites where the ruins were discovered. Following the defeat of the Helvetii at the Battle of Bibracte of 58 BC, over the next decades much of Switzerland was incorporated into the Roman Empire. The principal Roman settlements in Switzerland were the cities of Iulia Equestris (Nyon), Aventicum (Avenches), Augusta Raurica (Augst) and Vindonissa (Windisch). Evidence has also been found of almost twenty Roman villages (\"vici\") established in the 1st to 3rd century AD, as well as hundreds of villas of varying sizes built in the western and central part of the Swiss Plateau. The Legio XIII Gemina, was based in the permanent camp of Vindonissa (Windisch) and Aventicum (Avenches) was the capital of the Helvetii. Under pressure from internal and external forces, the Roman Army retreated and Switzerland became a border province in the 4th century. Nyon and Augusta Raurica were permanently abandoned during the 4th century, the stones of their ruins serving to fortify Geneva and Basel. Aventicum never recovered from its pillages: Ammianus Marcellinus noted in around 360 that \"the city was once very illustrious, as its half-ruined buildings attest.\" Today there are a number of excavated or rebuilt Roman sites in Switzerland. Some of the ruins of Roman settlements were later incorporated into houses, churches and city walls. All four of the major Roman cities have some relics of the Roman era. Augusta Raurica has parts of the amphitheater, aqueduct, the main forum and a theater. At Avenches the eastern gates and a tower, a thermal bath, the 16,000 seat amphitheater and temple ruins are still visible. At Nyon, the Roman ruins were lost until their rediscovery in the 18th century, which included the amphitheater and basilica. At Windisch the legionaries camp, an amphitheater and an aqueduct are all visible. The Pre-Romanesque period is considered to stretch from the emergence of the Merovingian kingdom in about 500 to the beginning of the 11th century Romanesque period, though there is considerable overlap. During the early centuries of this period, the area that would become Switzerland was sparsely populated and almost nothing remains of any buildings from the period between 500 and the late 8th century. During the Carolingian Renaissance of the 8th and 9th centuries many new monasteries and churches sprung up across Western Europe. Carolingian architecture borrowed heavily from Early Christian and Byzantine architecture and helped lead to the Romanesque style in the following centuries. To begin expanding their power into the deep forests and isolated mountain valleys, the Carolingian kings established several monasteries in Switzerland. One well preserved example of this style in Switzerland is Saint John Abbey, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was probably founded around 775 either on orders of Charlemagne or his Bishop in Chur. Many of the frescoes in the chapel are from the first half of the 9th century. Another well known example of Carolingian architecture is the Abbey of St. Gall, which while it was rebuilt in the Baroque style between 1755 and 1768, is based on the much older Carolingian monastery. The Abbey library of Saint Gall contains around 2,100 manuscripts from the 8th to the 15th centuries including the Plan of St. Gall the only surviving major architectural drawing from the 6th to the 13th centuries. The Plan is a drawing of a proposed, but never built, Benedictine monastery. Some of the defining characteristics of Romanesque architecture is solid walls with few, small, semi-circular, paired windows, groin vaults and in religious architecture rows of columns that separate the nave from the aisles. In the 11th and 12th centuries, architecture in Switzerland can be roughly divided into three zones of influence, the Lombards in the south, Burgundy in the west and Germanic in the north and east, though there is significant overlap. The Lombard and Burgundian craftsmen experimented with barrel and groined vaults and carved capitals and friezes. In the Germanic parts of Europe, the ecclesiastical Romanesque style often included an apse on both the eastern and western ends of the nave, such as was shown in the Plan of St. Gall. The western apse was often flanked by two symmetrical, square towers which may include a westwork. When the Cluniac reforms spread through Switzerland in the late 10th and 11th centuries, it triggered a wave of church and monastery construction. All five Bishops in the area (Basel, Chur, Geneva, Lausanne and Sion) built Romanesque cathedrals, which included a full range of Romanesque and later Gothic elements. Romainm\u00f4tier Priory and Payerne Priory were both daughter houses of Cluny and were built in the Cluniac inspired Romanesque style. Romainm\u00f4tier was built by Lombard trained craftsmen by Odilo of Cluny around the end of the 10th century and has remained generally unchanged since then. The central nave features pillars with simply carved capitals and a groined ceiling. The cathedrals at Basel and Constance and the monasteries at Schaffhausen and Einsiedeln were all built with two symmetric square towers flanking the main portal like Cluny. Though all four of these examples were later rebuilt in other styles, the Romanesque floor plan is generally still visible. The Grossm\u00fcnster in Zurich also shows Lombard elements despite being firmly in the Germanic zone. In addition to church and monastery construction, a number of Romanesque forts and castles were built throughout the country side. In German Switzerland wooden forts were replaced by stone towers, though in the French and Italian areas stone castles had remained common since the Roman era. These new castles featured a large, multi-story tower with thick, heavy walls. The central tower was then surrounded by a ring wall with towers and a gate house. As long distance trade increased, the castles were placed along rivers and mountain passes to collect tolls and regulate movement. The Counts of Savoy built castles with square ring walls and towers on the corners such as Grandson and Yverdon. The Counts of Z\u00e4hringen built large donjon like residence towers such as Thun Castle. The Counts of Kyburg built their castles with massive stones, visible in Kyburg Castle. Originating in 12th-century France and lasting into the 16th century, its characteristics include the pointed arch, the ribbed vault (which evolved from the joint vaulting of Romanesque architecture) and the flying buttress. Today, the style is known mainly from numerous Gothic churches and cathedrals scattered across Europe. In Switzerland many Romanesque churches and monasteries were built in the bishop's seat or were supported by the bishops. In contrast, Gothic churches were often built in growing towns and cities as a symbol of their wealth and power. The newly founded mendicant orders built gothic churches, plague houses and hospitals for much the same reason. By the late Gothic era a number of smaller Gothic parish churches were being built across the country. The style spread quickly into French-speaking Switzerland with the construction of Lausanne Cathedral beginning around 1170-90. The rose window from 1210 and statue decorated portal, from 1230, had come from France and in the following centuries would be widely copied throughout Switzerland. Around 1215 the Gothic upper portion of Geneva's Cathedral was completed on the Romanesque lower. From there Gothic spread gradually throughout the region driven by trade and the growing wealth of the mendicant orders. Between 1270 and the 14th century the Franciscans built Gothic churches or monasteries in Lucerne, Fribourg and Basel, the Dominican Order built two in Basel along with complexes in Bern, Zurich and at K\u00f6nigsfelden Monastery and the Augustinians built one in Fribourg. As the population grew during the 13th to 16th century, a number of new parishes were established. For example, around Zurich in the period between 1470 and 1525 over half of the approximately 100 parishes had a new Gothic church. Many of these new churches included a polygonal choir, lit with large windows and topped with a ribbed roof. The basilica nave had smooth walls and was topped with a flat roof. Many of these new parish churches included rich stained glass windows, some of which are still in place today. A French trained school of fresco painters developed in Waltensburg/Vuorz and decorated churches throughout Graub\u00fcnden with Gothic frescos. After the 1356 Basel earthquake, the damaged choir of Basel's cathedral was rebuilt in a Gothic Rayonnant style. The towers and west fa\u00e7ade were rebuilt in Gothic style during the 15th century. In 1421 construction began on the Bern Minster, one of the most important late-Gothic buildings in Switzerland. Its size and ornate design were a testament to the growing wealth and power of the new city-state. Throughout Zurich, Graub\u00fcnden and Valais a number of new Gothic parish churches sprung up throughout the 15th and 16th centuries. However, in Inner Switzerland, the only new construction was the parish church of St. Oswald in Zug. In contrast to the ornate and distinctive Gothic churches, Gothic secular buildings tended to be understated and include only a few Gothic elements. Wealthy traders and patricians built houses with pointed arch windows or other Gothic decorations. The city halls of newly powerful cities such as Bern, Fribourg and Basel include a few Gothic elements (the ceiling in Bern, the star-ribbed vaulting in Fribourg) but lack a unified motif. The Renaissance style spread into Switzerland around the 16th century, reaching Ticino earlier than the rest of Switzerland. Renaissance style places emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts as they are demonstrated in the architecture of classical antiquity and in particular ancient Roman architecture, of which many examples remained. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aedicules replaced the more complex proportional systems and irregular profiles of Gothic buildings. As the Renaissance spread north from Italy, many churches in Ticino were decorated or rebuilt in the new style. In 1517 the Cathedral of San Lorenzo in Lugano was rebuilt with a massive Renaissance fa\u00e7ade. The fa\u00e7ade of the Church of Pietro e Stefano in Bellinzona was begun in the Renaissance style, but completed in Baroque. A third major Renaissance work in Ticino is the church of S. Croce in Riva San Vitale. S. Croce was built in the late 16th Century and could be argued to represent either the late Renaissance or early Baroque. North of the Alps, mostly secular buildings were built in the Renaissance style. The first Renaissance buildings were in Basel in 1556, but were built by master craftsmen from Ticino. This was followed by the Ritter'sche Palast and town hall in Lucerne and a town hall in Zurich. The Munot in Schaffhausen and the fortifications near Bellinzona are the only two large Renaissance structures in Switzerland. The Munot was built in 1564-89 on a design of Albrecht D\u00fcrer, while the fortifications were built in the 15th century by Milan to defend against the Swiss and were later used by the Swiss to defend against Milan. Baroque was a reaction to the changes of the Counter-reformation within the Catholic Church, and often followed the expansion of the new reform orders, the Jesuits and the Capuchins. It first entered Switzerland from Italy in the Canton of Graub\u00fcnden following the destruction of the Thirty Year's War. Some of the features of the style included broader naves and oval shapes in churches, pear shaped domes, fragmentary architectural elements, dramatic use of light, rich colors and ornaments, large ceiling frescoes, trompe l'oeil illusions and a fa\u00e7ade that often included a dramatic projection. By the mid to late 17th century, there were a number of master craftsmen families from Roveredo, San Vittore and surrounding communities in Graub\u00fcnden who led construction projects throughout Europe. To help repair the damage of the Bundner Wirren and the Thirty Year's War, Graub\u00fcnden craftsmen built numerous Capuchin hospices throughout the Canton before spreading out throughout Switzerland. New parish churches, monasteries, pilgrimage churches, chapels and roadside shrines were built across the country by both local and foreign craftsmen. In addition to religious buildings, hundreds of country manors and city houses along with town halls, hospitals, granaries and fortifications were all built in the new style. Since a key part of the Baroque style was the use of colors, realistic paintings and frescos and statues, many projects now included specialized artists who finished the exterior and interior as part of construction. Both local and foreign artists were active in Switzerland leading to rapidly spreading ideas. North of the Alps, each area had local families who specialized as sculptors, plaster workers and wood carvers. As they learned of the new style they incorporated its aesthetics into the numerous new churches. In the early 17th century artists from Ticino began to travel to Rome to learn the Baroque style of painting. Some of them, such as Giovanni Serodine from Ascona and Pier Francesco Mola from Coldrerio, remained in Rome, while others returned to Ticino to work. As the Baroque style spread, it was taken up by artists north of the Alps as well. Some of the most notable examples of Baroque include the church at Arlesheim, the Jesuit Church in Lucerne, Pf\u00e4fers Abbey, Disentis Abbey, Rheinau Abbey, Einsiedeln Abbey and the Abbey of Saint Gall. Classicism was a style that grew out of the neoclassical movement of the mid-18th century to around 1850. The style was based on a return to the architecture of classical antiquity in Rome and Greece and the Vitruvian architectural principles. It often included pillars supporting pediments and other geometric shapes such as cubes, cylinders and circles. During the mid to late 18th century, Switzerland was a haven for poets, artists, authors, philosophers, revolutionaries and architects. In Zurich the German speaking poets and authors Johann Jakob Bodmer, Johann Jakob Breitinger, Johann Kaspar Lavater, Salomon Gessner and Johann Heinrich F\u00fcssli wrote letters and shared ideas with their counterparts in Germany. In Geneva, Voltaire and Rousseau developed philosophies that influenced governments and revolutionaries throughout Europe. In Coppet, Madame Germaine de Sta\u00ebl led an influential salon of Parisian exiles. In Italy Swiss artists were exposed to both classical art and architecture as well as Neoclassical works. The ideas of Classicism, Romanticism, Humanism and Sturm und Drang, among others, flooded into the country. At the same time, the foundation of the Helvetische Gesellschaft in 1761 helped develop Switzerland's national identity and unify the country. The idea of a shared foundation of Republicanism (the Landsgemeinde), pastoral life in alpine meadows and the legend of William Tell were all part of the Classicism interpreted in Switzerland. Beginning in the 1760s many skilled architects, builders and artists from Ticino relocated to Imperial Russia. Over the following decades entire families worked to build many of the buildings in the Russian Empire's two capitals of St. Petersburg and Moscow. Only a few religious buildings were built in the Classicist style, but one of the largest is the Cathedral of St. Ursus in Solothurn. The majority of classicist buildings were government, business or mansions for the wealthy. One interesting example of Classicist sculpture is the \"Lion Monument\" in Lucerne, based on the design of Bertel Thorvaldsen. It commemorates the Swiss Guards who were massacred in 1792 during the French Revolution. The monument uses nature to honor Swiss heroes, both elements of Classicism. During this period the traditional western Swiss chalet, a small house tucked away on a high alpine meadow, begin to spread outside Switzerland. The chalet first appeared in Jean-Jacques Rousseau's writings where it spread to France and then throughout Europe. The chalet became a symbol of a simple, pastoral life built on democracy, freedom and a connection with nature. The wide variety of local styles and building materials was reduced to a wooden cottage with a gently sloping roof and wide, well-supported eaves set at right angles to the front of the house. At first, chalets appeared in the gardens and forests of wealthy European aristocrats, before spreading to mineral spas, resorts and other tourist destinations. By the second half of the 19th century, the chalet was a symbol of Switzerland and the word became common throughout the country. The design was well suited to be partially factory built and several companies manufactured chalet kits which were shipped throughout Europe. Art Nouveau was a style of art, architecture and decoration that was popular from the 1880s until about 1914. It was inspired by natural forms and shapes and featured curved lines and flowing shapes. It was a \"total\" art style, embracing architecture, graphic art, interior design, and most of the decorative arts including jewelry, furniture, textiles, household silver and other utensils, and lighting, as well as the fine arts. In French Switzerland it was known as Art Nouveau after Siegfried Bing's gallery Maison de l'Art Nouveau in Paris. In German Switzerland it was known as Jugendstil after the magazine \"Jugend\" in Munich, while in Italian Switzerland it was the Stile Liberty after the London department store Liberty & Co. Art Nouveau was brought into Switzerland by designers from across Europe. The style took hold in the industrial cantons, but also appeared in mountain resorts and mineral spas which catered to foreign visitors. While a few complete Art Nouveau buildings are scattered across the country, the industrial watch-making city of La Chaux-de-Fonds was a center of Art Nouveau. One of the leaders of this style in La Chaux-de-Fonds was Charles l'Eplattenier, who helped develop the local \"style sapin\" or \"pine style\", so called due to its intense study of nature and natural shapes. L'Eplattenier designed figures and decorative elements for the town's crematorium and designed the Mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de La Chaux-de-Fonds (Beaux Arts Museum of La-Chaux-de-Fonds). At the same time as Art Nouveau was spreading into Switzerland, a branch of Modern architecture known as \"Heimatstil\" or \"Heimatschutzstil\" was developing in Germany and German Switzerland. In contrast to Art Nouveau, the Heimatstil was a reaction to industrialization and urbanization and wanted to return to traditional living. This style focused on using traditional elements in modern buildings, while preserving historic buildings and cityscapes, traditional rural living and agriculture. Particularly in Switzerland the image of the Alps, alpine herding and agriculture became a key part of the movement. Each region of Switzerland began to incorporate local traditional materials and designs into modern houses, apartment buildings, hotels, schools and even industrial buildings. Heimatstil architects included Nicolaus Hartmann in Graub\u00fcnden, Armin Witmer-Karrer in Z\u00fcrich, Karl Inderm\u00fchle in Bern, Alphonse Laverri\u00e8re in Lausanne und Edmond Fatio in Geneva. In La Chaux-de-Fonds, Ren\u00e9 Chapallaz and his better known pupil Le Corbusier built several buildings that connected Heimatstil and Art Nouveau, including Villa Fallet which was Le Corbusier's first commission. Out of a desire to preserve the traditional, the Swiss Heritage Society was created on 1 July 1905 and by 1910 had over 7,000 members. The Society published a monthly magazine which included examples of \"good\" and \"bad\" architecture which reinforced the use of traditional designs. Later they led political campaigns against hydroelectric projects and highways and in 1962 were able to include protection of natural and architectural heritage in the Swiss Federal Constitution. Since 1972 the Heritage Society has awarded the Wakker Prize to recognize a community for exceptional preservation work. Modern architecture is a group of styles of architecture which emerged in the first half of the 20th century and became dominant after World War II. It was based upon new technologies of construction, particularly the use of glass, steel and reinforced concrete; and upon a rejection of the traditional neoclassical architecture and Beaux-Arts styles that were popular in the 19th century. The first school of architecture in Switzerland was the ETH Zurich Faculty of Architecture (ETHZ), which opened in 1855. The Zurich school trained architects quickly found work across the country and the world, designing private and public buildings. While the school initially focused on classical architecture, in 1915 Karl Coelestin Moser, an early leader in the Modern movement, was appointed a professor at ETHZ. In 1927 he designed St. Antonius Church in Basel, which was the first concrete church in Switzerland. In the 1920s Hans Benno Bernoulli built the Wasserhaus housing development, a novel cooperative settlement outside Basel. Following the model of the Deutscher Werkbund, in 1913 the Schweizerischer Werkbund (SWB) was established in Zurich which helped spread Modern architecture to German-speaking Switzerland. Additionally, one of the founding members of the SWB was the painter Charles L'Eplattenier, who returned to Yverdon and founded a French sister organization known as L'\u0152uvre (OEV). Both organizations encouraged close cooperation between artists, architects, designers and industry, though they differed in their approach to mass production and traditionalism. Both organizations continued to publish journals and influence design into the 21st century, though in 2003 the OEV was absorbed into the SWB and became a regional chapter. One of the most influential Modern Swiss architects was Charles-\u00c9douard Jeanneret, known as Le Corbusier. Le Corbusier studied art under Charles L'Eplattenier and Ren\u00e9 Chapallaz in La Chaux-de-Fonds and was initially influenced by his teachers' involvement in Art Nouveau, Heimatstil and L'\u0152uvre (OEV). He was a member of OEV for a few years before leaving in 1918. In the 1920s he developed a style that made use of reinforced concrete to create a weightless, open space with non-weight bearing facades that could be freely designed and decorated. In the 1940s he began working on urban planning and designed large, concrete modular buildings for offices and apartments, culminating in the design of the Chandigarh Capitol Complex in Chandigarh in the newly formed Indian state in the 1950s. Under the leadership of Swiss architects, including Le Corbusier, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Mandrot and Sigfried Giedion, the Congr\u00e8s International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) was organized in la Sarraz in 1928. Over the years that the CIAM was active, they formalized the architectural principles of the Modern movement and developed principles of urban planning that spread throughout the world. After World War II, Modern architecture became the dominant style throughout the country. At the same time it began to divide into many different forms and regional styles. In Ticino a group of architects including Tita Carloni, Luigi Snozzi, Bruno Reichlin, Fabio Reinhart and Mario Botta developed a style based on Functionalism and Rationalism and incorporating contrasts often with geometric designs and using local materials. The Graub\u00fcnden Movement consists of a number of Swiss architects who build modern structures that blend into the local villages. One of the most famous is Peter Zumthor, who builds simple, down to earth buildings with minimal use of resources. Other Graub\u00fcnden Movement architects include Valerio Olgiati, Andrea Deplazes and Gion A. Caminada. Traditional Swiss farm and village house design depended on a number of factors including the local climate, type of agriculture, materials available, local tradition and location. Each region in Switzerland developed their own style of vernacular architecture to meet these factors. Migrations such as the spread of the Walser into Valais, the spread of Germanic culture into the Romansh regions of Graub\u00fcnden and the Swiss invasion of Ticino allowed mixing of different traditional styles. The growth of alpine transhumance, were cattle summered in high alpine meadows and wintered in the valleys, required different designs for housing. Until the end of the Early Middle Ages most farms consisted of several separate buildings, each with a specific purpose. Beginning in the 11th century many of the out-buildings began to be combined into a single multi-purpose farm buildings. Farm houses now often contained living quarters, larders, stalls and feed storage under a single roof, but isolated by walls. The kitchens were generally chimney free until the 17th century, though in some poorer areas chimneys remained uncommon into the 19th century. However, using stone ovens or fireplaces to heat rooms became common by the 14th century in the northern Alpine foothills and Alpine valleys. External decoration became increasing visible on both wood and stone buildings after 1500. Fa\u00e7ade decoration reached its peak in the 17th and 18th centuries before becoming less common and simpler in the following centuries. In western Switzerland and the Jura mountains most houses were built of stone due to limited timber supplies. However, in northern Switzerland and the Bernese Mittelland plentiful wood meant that most construction was either all wood or wooden with a stone foundation. In both regions, by the 15th century, the local style had evolved into a multi-story, multi-purpose byre-dwelling with animals, fodder, storage and living quarters under one roof. Houses in the high Jura mountains were built with small windows to protect them from winter wind and snow, while those in the more temperate Swiss Plateau usually had lighter walls and larger windows. Shallowly sloping shingle roofs were replaced with ones with a steeper, tiled roof beginning in the 16th century. Other farmhouses remained thatched until the introduction of fire insurance in the 19th century after which they gradually disappeared. In the Bernese Oberland, the \"St\u00f6ckli\", a residence for the owner's aging parents, became a common sight in the 19th century. In the north-east along the Rhine river, half-timbered construction was imported from southern Germany and gradually spread into the eastern Middlelands. Other houses were built with stacked plank construction, such as the example from Wila below. Despite the different building materials, multi-story byre-dwellings developed in north-eastern and eastern Switzerland around the same time as they did in the west. In the 16th century restrictions on building and the rise of the home textile industry (the Putting-out system) led to the creation of the \"Flarz\", a complex of smaller apartments created by expanding existing buildings, in the Zurich Oberland. In the foothills of the Alps cattle breeding and dairy farming were common after the second half of the 13th century, which led to a different style. Unlike the more northern brye-dwelling, here the house and barn remained separate. Generally, they were each built as simple block structures made of heavy, square beams. The gable ends often have a windows and are protected by large eaves. In the Bernese Oberland the gable ends are often richly decorated. The design remained basically unchanged from the 12th century until the 19th, and is still built today. There is no clearly defined border between the brye-dwellings of the Swiss Plateau and the separate structures of the foothills so both designs may be present in a single village. In Valais the entire valley was originally French speaking until the 13th century when upper valley was settled by German speaking colonists. This led to differing architectural styles as well as extensive borrowing from the other culture. In the French speaking part, stone construction is much more common, while in the German speaking area, wooden beam styles dominate. However, in the Val d'Illiez region, the houses are generally wooden, but with a distinctive roof ridge that projects much further forward than the bottom of the roof. The modern Canton of Ticino was an Italian province conquered by the Old Swiss Confederation in the 15th century. The local architecture is more similar to that of northern Italy, though each small, isolated valley developed their own style. The southern most parts of the Canton the villages are small and compact while the farms are isolated, sprawling stone and wood complexes that developed over centuries as apartments, storage and production buildings were added. In the northern part, narrow alpine valleys limit the size of fields and villages. Northern Ticino was conquered and administered by Uri, Schwyz and Nidwalden. These foreign overlords brought the wooden block construction from the Alpine foothills into Ticino. However, in the last 200 years stone construction has replaced the earlier wooden structure in most villages in Ticino. Following the destruction of the local B\u00fcndner Wirren (part of the Thirty Years' War) in the 17th century, many of the houses in Graub\u00fcnden had to be rebuilt. The new houses were built of stone, often on top of or surrounding an earlier wooden building. In the Engadin valley they built stone byre-dwellings, typically with a \"Sul\u00e8r\", a wide passage through the residential section into the hay storage section. The kitchen, dining and storage rooms were branched off the \"Sul\u00e8r\". The upper story included a large hall known as the \"Stuva s\u00fcra\" as well as bedrooms. The basement housed the stables. Many of the houses were decorated with sgraffiti.",

        "input": "The Other Side of Heaven is a 2001 American adventure drama film written and directed by Mitch Davis, based on John H. Groberg's non-fiction book \"In the Eye of the Storm\". The film stars Christopher Gorham as Groberg and Anne Hathaway as Jean Groberg (n\u00e9e Sabin). The film is about Groberg's experiences as a missionary of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in the Tongan islands in the 1950s and is based on the book that he wrote about his real experiences, \"In the Eye of the Storm\". The film focuses on Groberg's adventurous experiences and trials while he serves as a missionary in the South Pacific. While portraying these events, the film discusses little LDS theology and focuses instead on the missionary experience. During the 1950s, John Groberg, (Christopher Gorham) who grew up in Idaho Falls, Idaho, graduates from Brigham Young University and is called on a mission to Tonga. There, he will spend two and one-half years as an Elder teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ. His first adventure is just getting there, as it takes him 83 days, including a short stint in a Fiji jail. When Elder Groberg arrives in Tonga, he is sent to a group of remote islands from the mission's home office. Before he leaves on this last leg he is assigned a companion, Tongan Feki (Joe Folau), who speaks English. However, Elder Groberg finds that his knowledge of the Tongan language is severely deficient and he studies intensely to become proficient. He also learns the culture. Throughout the film, the letters between Elder Groberg and his fianc\u00e9, Jean (Anne Hathaway), serve as a narrative. Although they write frequently, Elder Groberg is only able to send and receive mail monthly. Each of them voices the letters so that the audience knows what they are writing. Another man at home proposes to Jean but she maintains her agreement to wait for John. Elder Groberg soon begins to experience success in his mission. But one night he forgets instructions he received to cover his feet and rats bite his soles. It is a painful reminder that he must listen and obey when he receives instructions. Elder Groberg tells his fianc\u00e9 that she should send her suitor to him for the same lesson. The local Christian minister tells the people not to listen to the missionaries. Later, he sends four men to beat the missionaries. However, one of them, Tomasi, prevents the attack. Elder Groberg learns from the drunken Tomasi that he had been baptized a member of the LDS Church many years ago when a boy. Tomasi later begins attending church meetings and is chosen by Elder Groberg to be one of his counselors to the District. Elder Groberg is sought out by parents when their child is injured and left unconscious. Elder Groberg ministers to him with prayer and basic first aid, and the child recovers. A local young woman, at the behest of her family, attempts to seduce Elder Groberg. She wants \"a half-white baby.\" He teaches her about marriage and tells her he's saving his seed for Jean, and she relents. A typhoon strikes the island. Many trees are stripped bare, homes and crops are destroyed, and many people are killed. The remaining leaders instruct the people gather up what food and fresh water is available so that rationing can begin. The supply boat due in two weeks takes much longer to arrive. The inhabitants of the island begin dying of starvation and dehydration. Elder Groberg is close to death when the local minister gives him the last of his food because the minister is old and Elder Groberg is young. When the supply boat does arrive, the minister is found to have died and is given an honorable funeral. While traveling at sea, Elder Groberg and his two counselors are caught in a large storm. He is washed overboard and fears for his life. He swims until he finds an island where he also locates his counselors, and they are later rescued and return to Tonga. Elder Groberg returns one day to his hut to find that his mission president has come to visit the island. He finds the president and introduces himself. The president is unhappy because he has not heard from Elder Groberg since departing from the mission home office many months prior. Elder Groberg describes some of the success they have experienced, and the president is shocked to learn of new branches and meeting places on outer islands that the President did not authorize. After giving Elder Groberg a strong lecture about the discipline of the church, which is a \"House of Order,\" he leaves to spend the night in the village and prepares to leave the next day. Elder Groberg and his counselors spend the entire night filling out the baptismal, priesthood ordination, and other church records the president requested the day before. In the morning, Elder Groberg runs to the beach where the president is about to board a boat. He gives him a large sheaf of hand-typed forms documenting all they have accomplished on Raratonga and the outer islands. The President instructs Elder Groberg to send him the paperwork necessary to build new chapels and then adds, \"Since they will be built with concrete, we should probably purchase the land.\" The president submits a request to have Elder Groberg's mission extended, but it is denied. Elder Groberg receives a telegram via mail. It instructs him to return to New Zealand where he will obtain transportation home to Idaho. When Elder Groberg is ready to depart, many islanders gather in their best clothing to see him off, testifying to the impact he has had during his stay. His trip home is less eventful than his trip to Tonga. He finally arrives in Idaho. He and Jean are married and spend their honeymoon at a cottage by a beach. \"The Other Side of Heaven\" is based on John Groberg's book entitled \"In the Eye of the Storm\". Deseret Book, who owned the rights to the book, was hesitant to sell the rights for a movie due to concerns about how the LDS Church would be portrayed in the film. The fact that the producer, the director, and many of the filming crew were Latter-day Saints alleviated this concern. Deseret Book eventually sold the rights to the book allowing the film to be made. Gerald R. Molen, the producer, had worked on several notable films, including \"The Color Purple\", \"Rain Man\", \"Schindler's List\", and \"\". He won an Academy Award for his work in \"Schindler's List\" and is a Latter-day Saint. Mitch Davis, the director, had worked on several Disney films before this film. He won a CAMIE Award for this film, which was shared with Gerald R. Molen and several film crew members. He is a Latter-day Saint. The title of the film was changed from \"In the Eye of the Storm\" to \"The Other Side of Heaven\" to avoid confusion with \"The Perfect Storm\", which had been released a year earlier. Gorham was cast as Groberg because of his ability to balance the seriousness of the role with lighter, more comedic moments. He learned how to speak the Tongan parts with a flawless accent. Hathaway was cast as Jean Groberg (n\u00e9e Sabin) in the film. Her scenes were shot towards the end of the production. She immediately began working on \"The Princess Diaries\" after completing work on this film. The film was shot on location in New Zealand and Island of Rarotonga, capital of the Cook Islands. The opening scenes set at Brigham Young University were filmed in New Zealand. Polynesian actors from New Zealand were used for most of the roles. The less experienced ones relied heavily on the more experienced ones. The cast and crew enjoyed a great amount of cooperation from locals. When the film crew arrived on the island, the Prime Minister welcomed them by gathering all of the religious ministers of the community for a prayer meeting. They prayed that the film crew would be blessed with good weather. The photographs in the opening scenes are of the actual people portrayed in the film, provided by Groberg. The real Groberg, his wife Jean, one of his grandsons, and one of his daughters with her husband can be seen at the very end during the wedding scene. As the camera pans from right to left, his daughter, then her husband, then the grandson, then Groberg are taking a picture of the couple, and his wife is next to him clapping. During the opening dance scene, extras were hired from almost every swing club in New Zealand. Gorham and Hathaway did most of their own dancing. Hathaway was kicked in the head in one of the takes and was nearly knocked out. The scenes where Groberg learns the Tongan language were altered slightly for dramatic effect. He did isolate himself and study the Bible in both English and Tongan and went without food and water for several days. However, he spent time in a bush, rather than on a beach. Groberg and Feki's hut was recreated from photographs, an authentic replica of the one that they actually lived in. Groberg really did have rats eat the soles of his feet while he slept. When he awoke that morning, they split open, and the members of the branch helped treat his feet. He spent time outside with his feet pointed up at the sun in order to sear the soles of his feet with the heat from the sun. Later in life, he was diagnosed with skin cancer on the soles of his feet due to exposure to the sun. His doctor was puzzled about how he could have exposed the soles of his feet to the sun. Groberg responded to his doctor, \"Have I got a story to tell you...\" A boy really did fall from a mango tree. He was on his way to a church meeting on Tuesday. He climbed the tree because it had very good mangoes. He fell out of the tree and was knocked out. When he awoke on Thursday after being treated by Groberg, he was worried that he was late to his church meeting. The real Feki's father was not a drinking man, nor did he beat his wife. Liberties were taken in order to combine several characters. This particular alteration was done with the permission of the real Feki's children. The first cut of the film was 135 minutes and the final one was 113 minutes. The film's release was delayed to follow the release of the other Disney film, \"The Princess Diaries\", also starring Hathaway. It was hoped that the success of that film would garner a following for Hathaway and bring in extra earnings for this film. Disney took part only in the DVD release, which was distributed by Excel Entertainment Group. \"The Other Side of Heaven\" opened theatrically on December 14, 2001 in two venues, earning $55,765 in its opening weekend, ranking number 41 in the domestic box office. By the end of its run, almost a year later, on December 2, 2002, the film grossed $4,720,371 domestically and $39,643 overseas for a worldwide total of $4,760,014. The film received negative reviews from critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports a 29% rating based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 4.6 out of 10. The site's consensus states: \"\"The Other Side of Heaven\" preaches to the converted; others will likely consider it simplistic, even offensive, propaganda.\" On Metacritic, the film has a 38 out of 100 rating based on 16 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews.\" The audience reception was much more positive, averaging a 73% favorable rating on Rotten Tomatoes and 8.4 on Metacritic. In February 2018, it was announced that there will be a sequel titled \"The Other Side of Heaven II: Fire of Faith\". Gorham, Folau, Lees, and Smith will reprise their roles from the first film. Natalie Medlock will play Jean Groberg, replacing Hathaway. The movie will be based on Groberg's second autobiographical novel, with the same title, set ten years after the first film. The story follows John returning to the island with his wife and five daughters during the period of time he served as an LDS Church mission president. It is scheduled to be released on June 28, 2019.",

        "input": "Blue Thunder is a 1983 action thriller film from Columbia Pictures, produced by Gordon Carroll, Phil Feldman, and Andrew Fogelson and directed by John Badham. The film features a high-tech helicopter of the same name and stars Roy Scheider, Warren Oates, Candy Clark, Daniel Stern, and Malcolm McDowell. A spin-off television series, also called \"Blue Thunder\", ran for 11 episodes in 1984. Frank Murphy (Roy Scheider) is a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) air support division officer and troubled Vietnam War veteran with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). His newly assigned field partner is Richard Lymangood (Daniel Stern). The two patrol Los Angeles at night and give assistance to police forces on the ground. Murphy is instructed to attend a sunrise demonstration in the Mojave Desert at \"Pinkville\", and is selected to pilot the world's most advanced helicopter, originally called \"\"The Special\" \" and now nicknamed \"\"Blue Thunder\"\". It is one of two prototypes of a military-style combat aircraft intended for police use in surveillance and against possible large-scale civic disobedience during the 1984 Olympic venue. With powerful armament, and other accoutrements such as infrared scanners, powerful microphones and cameras, built-in mobile telephone, computer and modem, and a U-Matic VCR, Blue Thunder appears to be a formidable tool in the war on crime. Murphy notes wryly that with enough of these helicopters \"you could run the whole damn country.\" When the death of city councilwoman Diana McNeely turns out to be more than just a random murder, Murphy begins his own covert investigation. He discovers that a subversive action group is intending instead to use Blue Thunder in a military role to quell disorder under the project codename T.H.O.R. (\"Tactical Helicopter Offensive Response\"), and is secretly eliminating political opponents to advance its agenda. Murphy suspects the involvement of his old wartime nemesis, former United States Army Colonel F.E. Cochrane (Malcolm McDowell), the primary test pilot for Blue Thunder and someone who felt Murphy was \"unsuitable\" for the program. Murphy and Lymangood use Blue Thunder to record a meeting between Cochrane and the other government officials which would implicate them in the conspiracy, but Cochrane looks outside and sees Blue Thunder and realizes what has happened. After landing, Lymangood secures the tape and hides it, but is captured upon returning to his home, interrogated, and then killed while trying to escape. Murphy hijacks Blue Thunder and arranges to have his girlfriend Kate (Candy Clark) retrieve the tape and deliver it to the local news station, using the helicopter to thwart her pursuers. Kate arrives at the news station, but is almost captured by one of the conspirators; the reporter Kate was sent to find intercepts Kate and gets the tape back, while the conspirator is knocked unconscious by a security guard. Two Air National Guard F-16 fighters are deployed to deal with Murphy, but he manages to shoot one down and evade the other. However, in the process, one missile destroys a barbeque stand in Little Tokyo and a second impacts a building in Downtown Los Angeles. The operation is then suspended by the mayor. Cochrane, disobeying orders to stand down, confronts Blue Thunder in a heavily armed Hughes 500 helicopter, and after a tense battle, Murphy is able to shoot him down after executing a 360\u00b0 loop through use of Blue Thunder's turbine boost function. Murphy then destroys Blue Thunder by landing it in front of an approaching freight train. In the meantime, the tape is made public and, as a result, the conspirators are arrested. Co-writers Dan O'Bannon and Don Jakoby began developing the plot while living together in a Hollywood apartment in the late 1970s, where low-flying police helicopters woke them on a regular basis. Their original script was a more political one, attacking the concept of a police state controlling the population through high-tech surveillance and heavy armament. They sought and received extensive script help from Captain Bob Woods, then-chief of the LAPD's Air Support Division. The first draft of the screenplay for \"Blue Thunder\" was written in 1979 and featured Frank Murphy as more of a crazy main character with deeper psychological issues, who went on a rampage and destroyed much of Los Angeles before finally falling to F-16s. Filmed on location in Los Angeles beginning in the early months of 1980, \"Blue Thunder\" was one of Warren Oates' last films before his death on April 3, 1982, which occurred during post-production, and the film is dedicated to him. He made one movie and one TV episode before and after filming during 1981-1982 that were released after \"Blue Thunder.\" The LAPD Hooper Heliport served as home base for the fictional police unit while construction of the heliport was still being completed. The drive-in theater scene where Frank's girlfriend Kate recovers the tape was filmed at the Pickwick Theatre in Burbank, California; the theater has since then been demolished and replaced by a Pavilions supermarket. Malcolm McDowell, who portrayed antagonist F. E. Cochrane, was intensely afraid of flying, and not even his then wife Mary Steenburgen could persuade him to overcome his phobia. In an interview for \"Starlog\" in 1983, Badham recalled, \"He was terrified. He used to get out and throw up after a flight.\" McDowell's grimaces and discomfort can be seen during the climactic battle between Murphy and Cochrane in the film. Steenburgen commented to filmmakers afterward, \"I don't know how you got him up there, I can't even get him in a 747!\" Designer Mickey Michaels invented the helicopters used in the film after reviewing and rejecting various existing designs. The helicopters used for \"Blue Thunder\" were French built A\u00e9rospatiale SA-341G Gazelles modified with bolt-on parts and Apache-style canopies. Two modified Gazelle helicopters, a Hughes 500 helicopter, and two radio-controlled F-16 fighter models were used in the filming of the movie. The helicopters were purchased from A\u00e9rospatiale by Columbia Pictures for $190,000 each and flown to Cinema Air in Carlsbad, California where they were heavily modified for the film. These alterations made the helicopters so heavy that various tricks had to be employed to make it look fast and agile in the film. For instance, the 360\u00b0 loop maneuver Murphy performs at the end of the film, which catches Cochrane so completely by surprise that he is easily shot down by Murphy's gunfire and killed, was carried out by a radio controlled model. \"Blue Thunder\" was released on May 13, 1983. It was the #1 ranked film in the United States on its opening weekend, taking in $8,258,149 at 1,539 theaters, overtaking the previous #1 film \"Flashdance\". The film was ranked #2 in its second and third weekends. Overall, in the US, it took in $42,313,354 for its 66 days of release. \"Blue Thunder\" was released in West Germany on February 5, 1983, before its US release, being released worldwide between June and September 1983. Its UK release was August 25, 1983. It was released in East Germany and South Korea in 1984. Its total international box office income is unreported. The film made $21.9 million in video rentals in the US. \"Blue Thunder\" received positive reviews, being given an 80% positive rating at the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 20 reviews. \"Variety\" called it \"a ripsnorting live-action cartoon, utterly implausible but no less enjoyable for that\". C.J. Henderson reviewed \"Blue Thunder\" in \"The Space Gamer\" No. 63. Henderson commented that \"\"Blue Thunder\" is this year's must-see action film. See it.\" An acronym used in the film, \"JAFO\", meaning \"Just Another Fucking Observer\", is police community and is mentioned repeatedly in the film in reference to any police helicopter's non-pilot second officer, in this case Daniel Stern's character of Richard Lymangood. In the related TV series, the reference is expurgated as \"Just Another \"Frustrated\" Observer\". A screen still from Blue Thunder of the helicopter flying in front of the Los Angeles skyline is used as the background image of the title screen in the Sega 1987 video game Thunder Blade. In 1987, Coca-Cola Telecommunications released a \"Blue Thunder\" video tape cartridge for Worlds of Wonder's short lived Action Max game system. Using footage from the film, the player plays the pilot of the Blue Thunder helicopter as he tries to prevent the World Peace Coalition from being attacked by a terrorist organization. , Sony proposed a remake of \"Blue Thunder\" focusing on drone technology, with Dana Brunetti and Michael De Luca as producers, and Craig Kyle as writer.",

Nominations for this award are closely correlated with the Academy Award for Best Picture. For 33 consecutive years, 1981 to 2013, every Best Picture winner had also been nominated for the Film Editing Oscar, and about two thirds of the Best Picture winners have also won for Film Editing. Only the principal, \"above the line\" editor(s) as listed in the film's credits are named on the award; additional editors, supervising editors, etc. are not currently eligible. The nominations for this Academy Award are determined by a ballot of the voting members of the Editing Branch of the Academy; there were 220 members of the Editing Branch in 2012. The members may vote for up to five of the eligible films in the order of their preference; the five films with the largest vote totals are selected as nominees. The Academy Award itself is selected from the nominated films by a subsequent ballot of all active and life members of the Academy. This process is essentially the reverse of that of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA); nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Editing are done by a general ballot of Academy voters, and the winner is selected by members of the editing chapter. This award was first given for films released in 1934. The name of this award is occasionally changed; in 2008, it was listed as the Academy Award for Achievement in Film Editing. Four film editors have won this award three times in their career: To date, two film directors have won this award, James Cameron and Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n for the films \"Titanic\" and \"Gravity\", respectively. Directors David Lean, Steve James, Joel Coen and Ethan Coen (under the alias \"Roderick Jaynes\"), Michel Hazanavicius and Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e (under the alias \"John Mac McMurphy\") have been nominated for editing their own films, with Cameron, Cuar\u00f3n, and the Coens each being nominated for the award twice. Additionally, Best Film Editing winner, Walter Murch, although known for film editing and sound, directed the Oscar nominated \"Return to Oz\" and is, to date, the only person with Oscars for both sound engineering and film editing, winning them in the same year for his work on \"The English Patient\". Also, nominated editors Robert Wise, Francis D. Lyon, who won for \"Body and Soul\" and Hal Ashby, who won for \"In the Heat of the Night\", became directors whose films were in turn nominated for Best Film Editing, namely \"Somebody Up There Likes Me\", \"I Want to Live!\", \"West Side Story\", \"The Sound of Music\", \"The Sand Pebbles\" and \"The Andromeda Strain\" for Wise, \"Crazylegs\" for Lyon and \"Bound for Glory\" and \"Coming Home\" for Ashby.

        "input": "Randhurst Village, previously known as Randhurst Mall and Randhurst Center or simply Randhurst, is a shopping mall located at the corner of Rand Road (U.S. Route 12) and Elmhurst Road (Illinois Route 83) in Mount Prospect, Illinois. The mall took its name from combining the names of these two roads. The original owner of the mall was the Randhurst Corporation (a joint venture of Carson Pirie Scott, Wieboldt's, and Montgomery Ward). At the time of its 1962 opening, it was the first enclosed regional mall in the Chicago area and the largest enclosed air-conditioned space in the United States. In 2009, the mall was demolished and rebuilt as Randhurst Village. Currently owned by DLC Management, this open-air mixed-use center features national and regional retailers, several restaurants, second-floor offices, a 140-room hotel and a 12-screen cinema. It is now anchored by AMC Theatres, Costco Wholesale and Hampton by Hilton. Other stores include Bed, Bath & Beyond, Home Depot, Jewel-Osco, PetSmart, and T.J.Maxx among others. Randhurst was born out of a desire by Carson Pirie Scott to expand its business into Chicago's northwest suburbs, an untapped market at the time. Spurred by Marshall Field's expansion into Skokie at the new Old Orchard Shopping Center in 1958, Carson Pirie Scott secured an lot in Mount Prospect for purposes of building a shopping mall. Studies showed the mall would have a service area of 300,000, with another 100,000 expected by 1965. By 1959, the department stores Wieboldt's and Montgomery Ward had created a joint venture with Carson Pirie Scott, named the Randhurst Corporation. Instead of using the Montgomery Ward nameplate, however, Montgomery Ward would use the nameplate of its subsidiary brand, The Fair Department Store (a.k.a. \"the Fair\"), on its anchor store. Randhurst was designed by Victor Gruen, a pioneer of modern shopping mall design. Unlike most shopping malls of the time, which were built in a straight line between two anchoring department stores, Gruen's design was shaped like an equilateral triangle, with an anchoring department store at each angle. Additional stores lined the sides of the triangle on two levels: a conventional level (termed the \"mezzanine\" level), continuous with the first floors of the anchor stores, and a level located half a floor below the first level (termed the \"bazaar\" level), located down a flight of stairs facing the first level. A floor of offices occupied the level above this \"subfloor\" of stores. A ring of clerestory windows was mounted in a domed area over the center of the mall; mounted just inside these windows were numerous stained glass windows in various oval and round shapes, oriented in such a way as to cast beams of colored light into the mall itself. As the mall was built at the height of the Cold War, it included a fallout shelter big enough to hold every citizen of Mount Prospect. Thus, at the time of its 1962 opening, the Randhurst had three major department store anchors: Wieboldt's, Carson Pirie Scott, and The Fair. All three anchors had two above-ground floors and a full basement. Of the three anchors, the Carson Pirie Scott anchor was the most distinctive, featuring turquoise-colored accents at the entrances and multi-colored lights around its perimeter. Other stores included Baskins, Charles A. Stevens, Jewel Food Stores, S.S. Kresge, and Woolworth's. In 1963, the Randhurst Fair store would be the first Fair store to be renamed as a Montgomery Ward store; Montgomery Ward also built an auto service center at the perimeter of the mall. Randhurst would retain this configuration well into the 1980s. In 1981, The Rouse Company acquired Randhurst from the Randhurst Corporation. In 1985, Rouse converted the upper sub-level of offices into a food court\u2013one of the first in the Chicago area\u2013and more retail space; a complete conventional second floor of retail space would be constructed by 1990. The \"subfloor\" of stores was also made larger and easier to access. In 1987, the entire Wieboldt's chain went bankrupt and closed its stores; Peoria, Illinois-based Bergner's acquired the empty Randhurst location. Shortly thereafter, Elgin-based specialty department store Joseph Spiess Company built a minor anchor, , next to the Wieboldt's/Bergner's anchor, and MainStreet added another minor anchor near the Montgomery Ward anchor (just before the chain was acquired by Kohl's). Spiess expanded too rapidly and too late for the market; as a consequence of this, the chain went bankrupt, and the store at Randhurst closed on January 31, 1992. In 1990, Bergner's\u2013which had acquired Carson Pirie Scott in 1989\u2013closed its Randhurst store, allowing the Carson Pirie Scott anchor to move into the grander ex-Wieboldt's building while JCPenney took over the former Carson Pirie Scott anchor. Wickes Furniture briefly occupied the Spiess anchor, until Circuit City and Old Navy took over the space in 1995; meanwhile, a new Filene's Basement minor anchor occupied the majority of the \"bazaar\" level. This brought Randhurst to its greatest level of occupancy ever\u2013three major anchors and four minor anchors\u2013and an all-time peak of of retail space. The next ten years, however, would be much more difficult for Randhurst. The construction and expansion of multiple shopping malls in the area, especially the improvements to Woodfield Mall in nearby Schaumburg, devastated Randhurst's shopping base, as did the local population's general change in shopping tastes. In 1996, the mall's management tried to compensate by updating the mall's decor and adding new Jewel-Osco and Home Depot stores at the perimeter of the mall (the Home Depot replacing the closed Child World building, formerly the Randhurst Ice Arena, and Wards Auto Center); despite this, foot traffic fell, and stores began disappearing from the mall at a rapid rate. This included the Filene's Basement minor anchor, which closed in 1999 (along with three other Chicago-area Filene's Basement stores). In June 1999, Borders added and closed in April 2011. The problems for Randhurst continued as one of Chicago's first lifestyle centers, Deer Park Town Center, opened in north suburban Deer Park in 2000. This open-air shopping center became increasingly popular and may have attracted patrons who would have otherwise traveled to Randhurst or nearby Woodfield. Meanwhile, Randhurst suffered the loss of its JCPenney and Montgomery Ward anchors within months of each other in 2001. JCPenney had labeled the Randhurst store as an \"underperformer,\" and therefore closed the location as they did many other \"underperforming\" locations. The Montgomery Ward anchor was remodeled and rebranded as \"Wards\" in 2000 as part of a chain-wide \"last-ditch\" effort to revive the brand; when this failed, Wards closed its entire chain of stores and went out of business. In 2003, Kohl's moved its store to a space formerly occupied by Venture/Big Kmart near the corner of Elmhurst Road and Dempster Street on the south end of Mount Prospect. Following the sudden departure of these three anchor tenants, many stores inside the mall closed as well. The devastating loss of numerous tenants and anchors led many to believe that Randhurst was about to become a dead mall. In 2004, some revitalization did occur for the mall, as a grand remodeling and repositioning scheme for the mall was put in motion. The former JCPenney and Kohl's anchors were demolished to build a new Costco anchor with no entry to the mall proper. Similarly, the former Montgomery Ward anchor was mostly torn down to create a grand new \"promenade\" entrance for the mall. Unfortunately, no upscale stores ever moved into the new addition, however Applebee's did move from another section of the mall. Unlike its previous home, which had both exterior and interior entrances, the new location was serviced by an outdoor entrance exclusively. A Buffalo Wild Wings was built on an outlot close to Carson's and Jewel-Osco. Circuit City closed in early 2005, and Old Navy moved to nearby Arlington Heights, all in the midst of the new construction. Bed Bath & Beyond and Steve & Barry's quickly took their places\u2013Bed Bath & Beyond moved into the former Circuit City retail space, while Steve & Barry's opened in the former Applebee's restaurant and Old Navy spaces in 2004 and 2005. The Gruen design had been partially destroyed, and the renovation only helped temporarily stem the tenant outflow. In April 2007, the village of Mount Prospect approved a plan that included the demolition of the core of Randhurst. Designs by Larry Beame of Beame Architectural Partnership enabled the existing anchors to remain standing and be integrated into the redeveloped lifestyle center. Beame said the goal was to create \u201ca traditional Main Street shopping experience\u201d that features a primary retail street with diagonal parking and public spaces for socializing. The redevelopment was set to begin within two years. Randhurst's final shopping day was Tuesday, September 30, 2008. By then, only two stores remained open inside the mall: Fashion Plus, and Your Choice Gifts. Both stores were ordered by management to be vacated by 9:00pm CST. Demolition began in the winter of 2008/2009 with the mall offices near Carson Pirie Scott so a new loading ramp could be constructed for the department store. The mall was then gutted as it still contained hazardous asbestos insulation. By the following summer, visible demolition work had resumed. Less than eleven months after Randhurst closed, the mall's signature dome was pulled down on August 28, 2009, ending the existence of Cook County's first enclosed mall. Construction of Randhurst Village began in the fall of 2009. Bon-Ton Stores, Inc. announced a remodeling of the former mall's Carson Pirie Scott anchor in May 2009, which was completed in November 2010. A new AMC movie theater, with 12 screens, replaced the Randhurst 16 (it was General Cinema until 2002) outparcel theater (originally the General Cinema Fourplex (1962\u20131998)) in April 2011. T.J.Maxx and Old Navy also opened in Randhurst during 2011 while The Sports Authority replaced Steve & Barry's. Several signification changes occurred in 2012. A 120-room Hampton Inn & Suites opened alongside several of new retailers and restaurants that included PetSmart, Five Guys and Chipotle. The mall\u2019s existing bomb shelter had been converted into underground parking for hotel guests. It was also announced that Experience, Parmida Homes and Torrid would be moving into the lifestyle center by the end of the year. Construction began on new buildings for BlackFinn Ameripub, @The Children\u2019s Place and Panera. During this time, there were roughly 320,000 people in the area and very little restaurant competition for the lunchtime crowds. In early 2013, Chef Rodelio Aglibot and his partners opened E+O (Earth and Ocean) Food and Drink in Randhurst Village. This spacious restaurant featured an upscale menu and oversized patio to satisfy the demand from nearby business employees. After owning Randhurst Village for 22 years, JPMorgan Chase announced plans to sell the 1 million-square-foot lifestyle center in 2014. Several development companies expressed interest in purchasing the property over the next year until it was finally sold to New York-based DLC Management. At the time, it was the largest asset in DLC\u2019s portfolio. Sports Authority closed due to Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in 2016. Michael's took this place in 2017. On April 18, 2018, the Bon-Ton Stores, Inc. company (owner of Carson's) announced that all of its stores will be going into liquidation and wrap up corporations on August 29, 2018 due to financial reasons. The Carson's store at Randhurst has had a little over 56 years of service in the Mount Prospect shopping community, and after 10 years of the indoor mall's closure, this store closed for good. Plans for entertainment or residential venues are likely options for filling in this vacant facility. Pace",

        "input": "The Lincoln Memorial is an American national memorial built to honor the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. It is located on the western end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C., across from the Washington Monument. The architect was Henry Bacon; the designer of the primary statue \u2013 \"Abraham Lincoln\", 1920 \u2013 was Daniel Chester French; the Lincoln statue was carved by the Piccirilli Brothers; and the painter of the interior murals was Jules Guerin. Dedicated in May 1922, it is one of several memorials built to honor an American president. It has always been a major tourist attraction and since the 1930s has been a symbolic center focused on race relations. The building is in the form of a Greek Doric temple and contains a large seated sculpture of Abraham Lincoln and inscriptions of two well-known speeches by Lincoln, The Gettysburg Address and his second inaugural address. The memorial has been the site of many famous speeches, including Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech, delivered on August 28, 1963, during the rally at the end of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Like other monuments on the National Mallincluding the nearby Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Korean War Veterans Memorial, and National World War II Memorial \u2013 the memorial is administered by the National Park Service under its National Mall and Memorial Parks group. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since October 15, 1966, and was ranked seventh on the American Institute of Architects 2007 list of America's Favorite Architecture. The memorial is open to the public 24 hours a day, and more than seven million people visit it annually. The first public memorial to United States President Abraham Lincoln in Washington, D.C., was a statue by Lot Flannery erected in front of the District of Columbia City Hall in 1868, three years after the Lincoln's assassination. Demands for a fitting national memorial had been voiced since the time of Lincoln's death. In 1867, Congress passed the first of many bills incorporating a commission to erect a monument for the sixteenth president. An American sculptor, Clark Mills, was chosen to design the monument. His plans reflected the nationalistic spirit of the time, and called for a structure adorned with six equestrian and 31 pedestrian statues of colossal proportions, crowned by a statue of Abraham Lincoln. Subscriptions for the project were insufficient. The matter lay dormant until the start of the 20th century, when, under the leadership of Senator Shelby M. Cullom of Illinois, six separate bills were introduced in Congress for the incorporation of a new memorial commission. The first five bills, proposed in the years 1901, 1902, and 1908, met with defeat because of opposition from Speaker Joe Cannon. The sixth bill (Senate Bill 9449), introduced on December 13, 1910, passed. The Lincoln Memorial Commission had its first meeting the following year and United States President William H. Taft was chosen as the commission's president. Progress continued at a steady pace and by 1913 Congress had approved of the Commission's choice of design and location. There were questions regarding the commission's plan. Many thought that architect Henry Bacon's Greek temple design was far too ostentatious for a man of Lincoln's humble character. Instead they proposed a simple log cabin shrine. The site too did not go unopposed. The recently reclaimed land in West Potomac Park was seen by many to be either too swampy or too inaccessible. Other sites, such as Union Station, were put forth. The Commission stood firm in its recommendation, feeling that the Potomac Park location, situated on the Washington Monument\u2013Capitol axis, overlooking the Potomac River and surrounded by open land, was ideal. Furthermore, the Potomac Park site had already been designated in the McMillan Plan of 1901 to be the location of a future monument comparable to that of the Washington Monument. With Congressional approval and a $300,000 allocation, the project got underway. On February 12, 1914, a dedication ceremony was conducted and the following month the actual construction began. Work progressed steadily according to schedule. Some changes were made to the plan. The statue of Lincoln, originally designed to be tall, was enlarged to to prevent it from being overwhelmed by the huge chamber. As late as 1920, the decision was made to substitute an open portal for the bronze and glass grille which was to have guarded the entrance. Despite these changes, the Memorial was finished on schedule. Commission president William H. Taft \u2013 who was then Chief Justice of the United States \u2013 dedicated the Memorial on May 30, 1922, and presented it to United States President Warren G. Harding, who accepted it on behalf of the American people. Lincoln's only surviving son, 78-year-old Robert Todd Lincoln, was in attendance. The Memorial was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. During the administration of President Richard M. Nixon, while the Vietnam War was underway, the publisher of \"Reader's Digest\" magazine, Hobart Lewis, conceived the idea of July 4, 1970 being designated as \"Honor America Day\". Funds were raised by the head of the Mariott Hotel chain, J. Willard Marriott, and both Republicans and Democrats served in honorary positions on the committee organizing the event, which was touted as being non-partisan. The day ended with a televised show at the Lincoln Memorial called \"Salute to America\", which was co-hosted by evangelist Billy Graham and comedian Bob Hope. The show featured Kate Smith singing \"God Bless America\", comedian Red Skelton reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, and performances by Jack Benny, Dinah Shore, Pat Boone, The New Christy Minstrels and Glen Campbell, among others. The actor James Stewart provided narration. Nixon did not appear at the event, instead sending a recorded video message. The event ended with fireworks. The \"Salute to America\" drew 350,000 people to the National Mall, but also numerous protesters of various kinds, including those opposed to the war in Vietnam, the neo-Nazi National Socialist White People's Party and people advocating for the legalization of marijuana. Tear gas was used on the protesters just before Bob Hope took the stage, prompted Hope to say \"It looks just like Vietnam, doesn't it?\" On Independence Day 2019, President Donald Trump initiated another televised \"Salute to America\" event at the Lincoln Memorial. It featured a speech by Trump honoring the history of the United States and the achievements of historical American figures, as well as fireworks, flybys by aircraft from the United States armed forces, and displays of tanks. Special guests included Clarence Henderson, a hero of the Civil rights movement and NASA's Gene Kranz, the flight director for Apollo 11. Tickets to the special VIP section were provided to the Republican National Committee and Trump's re-election campaign, but not to the Democratic National Committee. It is usual at presidential special events for both the RNC and DNC to receive ticket allotments. Protesters were kept away from the event and were located at the Washington Monument. One group inflated a tall \"Trump Baby\" balloon, which was not allowed by the National Park Service to be flown off the ground. After the \"Salute to America\", Washington's regular annual July 4 event took place at the other end of the Mall. The exterior of the Memorial echoes a classic Greek temple and features Yule marble quarried from Colorado. The structure measures and is tall. It is surrounded by a peristyle of 36 fluted Doric columns, one for each of the 36 states in the Union at the time of Lincoln's death, and two columns in-antis at the entrance behind the colonnade. The columns stand tall with a base diameter of . Each column is built from 12 drums including the capital. The columns, like the exterior walls and facades, are inclined slightly toward the building's interior. This is to compensate for perspective distortions which would otherwise make the memorial appear to bulge out at the top when compared with the bottom, a common feature of Ancient Greek architecture. Above the colonnade, inscribed on the frieze, are the names of the 36 states in the Union at the time of Lincoln's death and the dates in which they entered the Union. Their names are separated by double wreath medallions in bas-relief. The cornice is composed of a carved scroll regularly interspersed with projecting lions' heads and ornamented with palmetto cresting along the upper edge. Above this on the attic frieze are inscribed the names of the 48 states present at the time of the Memorial's dedication. A bit higher is a garland joined by ribbons and palm leaves, supported by the wings of eagles. All ornamentation on the friezes and cornices was done by Ernest C. Bairstow. The Memorial is anchored in a concrete foundation, in depth, constructed by M. F. Comer and Company and the National Foundation and Engineering Company, and is encompassed by a rectangular granite retaining wall measuring in height. Leading up to the shrine on the east side are the main steps. Beginning at the edge of the Reflecting Pool, the steps rise to the Lincoln Memorial Circle roadway surrounding the edifice, then to the main portal, intermittently spaced with a series of platforms. Flanking the steps as they approach the entrance are two buttresses each crowned with an tall tripod carved from pink Tennessee marble by the Piccirilli Brothers. The Memorial's interior is divided into three chambers by two rows of four Ionic columns, each tall and across at their base. The central chamber, housing the statue of Lincoln, is 60 feet wide, 74 feet deep, and 60 feet high. The north and south chambers display carved inscriptions of Lincoln's second inaugural address and his Gettysburg Address. Bordering these inscriptions are pilasters ornamented with fasces, eagles, and wreaths. The inscriptions and adjoining ornamentation are by Evelyn Beatrice Longman. The Memorial is replete with symbolic elements. The 36 columns represent the states of the Union at the time of Lincoln's death; the 48 stone festoons above the columns represent the 48 states in 1922. Inside, each inscription is surmounted by a mural by Jules Guerin portraying principles seen as evident in Lincoln's life: Freedom, Liberty, Immortality, Justice, and the Law on the south wall; Unity, Fraternity, and Charity on the north. Cypress trees, representing Eternity, are in the murals' backgrounds. The murals' paint incorporated kerosene and wax to protect the exposed artwork from fluctuations in temperature and moisture. The ceiling consists of bronze girders ornamented with laurel and oak leaves. Between these are panels of Alabama marble, saturated with paraffin to increase translucency. But feeling that the statue required even more light, Bacon and French designed metal slats for the ceiling to conceal floodlights, which could be modulated to supplement the natural light; this modification was installed in 1929. The one major alteration since was the addition of a handicapped elevator in the 1970s. Below the memorial is an undercroft. Due to water seeping through the calcium carbonate within the marble, over time stalactites and stalagmites have formed within the undercroft. During the 1970s and 1980s, there were regular tours of the undercroft. The tours stopped abruptly in 1989 after a visitor noticed asbestos and notified the National Park Service. For the memorial's centennial in 2022, the undercroft is planned to be open to visitors following a rehabilitation project funded by David Rubenstein. Lying between the north and south chambers of the open-air Memorial is the central hall, which contains the large solitary figure of Abraham Lincoln sitting in contemplation. Its sculptor, Daniel Chester French, supervised the Piccirilli Brothers in its construction, and it took four years to complete. The statue, carved from Georgia white marble, was shipped in twenty-eight pieces. Originally intended to be only tall, on further consideration the sculpture was enlarged to from head to foot. If Lincoln were depicted standing he would be tall. The widest span of the statue corresponds to its height, and it rests upon an oblong pedestal of Tennessee marble high, wide, and deep. Directly beneath this lies a platform of Tennessee marble about long, wide, and high. Lincoln's arms rest on representations of Roman fasces, a subtle touch that associates the statue with the Augustan (and imperial) theme (obelisk and funerary monuments) of the Washington Mall. The statue is discretely bordered by two pilasters, one on each side. Between these pilasters, and above Lincoln's head, is engraved an epitaph of Lincoln by Royal Cortissoz. The sculpture has been at the center of two urban legends. Some have claimed that the face of General Robert E. Lee was carved onto the back of Lincoln's head, and looks back across the Potomac toward his former home, Arlington House, now within the bounds of Arlington National Cemetery. Another popular legend is that Lincoln is shown using sign language to represent his initials, with his left hand shaped to form an \"A\" and his right hand to form an \"L\", the president's initials. The National Park Service denies both legends. However, historian Gerald Prokopowicz writes that, while it is not clear that sculptor Daniel Chester French intended Lincoln's hands to be formed into sign language versions of his initials, it is possible that French did intend it, because he was familiar with American Sign Language, and he would have had a reason to do so, that is, to pay tribute to Lincoln for having signed the federal legislation giving Gallaudet University, a university for the deaf, the authority to grant college degrees. The National Geographic Society's publication \"Pinpointing the Past in Washington, D.C.\" states that Daniel Chester French had a son who was deaf and that the sculptor was familiar with sign language. Historian James A. Percoco has observed that, although there are no extant documents showing that French had Lincoln's hands carved to represent the letters \"A\" and \"L\" in American Sign Language, \"I think you can conclude that it's reasonable to have that kind of summation about the hands.\" The Memorial has become a symbolically sacred venue especially for the Civil Rights Movement. In 1939, the Daughters of the American Revolution refused to allow the African-American contralto Marian Anderson to perform before an integrated audience at the organization's Constitution Hall. At the suggestion of Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harold L. Ickes, the Secretary of the Interior, arranged for a performance on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on Easter Sunday of that year, to a live audience of 75,000 and a nationwide radio audience. On August 28, 1963, the memorial grounds were the site of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which proved to be a high point of the American Civil Rights Movement. It is estimated that approximately 250,000 people came to the event, where they heard Martin Luther King Jr., deliver his historic \"I Have a Dream\" speech before the memorial honoring the president who had issued the Emancipation Proclamation 100 years earlier. King's speech, with its language of patriotism and its evocation of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, was meant to match the symbolism of the Lincoln Memorial as a monument to national unity. The D.C. police also appreciated the location because it was surrounded on three sides by water, so that any incident could be easily contained. Twenty years later, on August 28, 1983, crowds gathered again to mark the 20th Anniversary Mobilization for Jobs, Peace and Freedom, to reflect on progress in gaining civil rights for African Americans and to commit to correcting continuing injustices. King's speech is such a part of the Lincoln Memorial story, that the spot on which King stood, on the landing eighteen steps below Lincoln's statue, was engraved in 2003 in recognition of the 40th anniversary of the event. At the memorial on May 9, 1970, President Richard Nixon had a middle-of-the-night impromptu, brief meeting with protesters who, just days after the Kent State shootings, were preparing to march against the Vietnam War. In September 1962, amid the civil rights movement, vandals painted the words \"nigger lover\" in foot-high pink letters on the rear wall. On the morning of July 26, 2013, the memorial was shut down after the statue's base and legs were splashed with green paint. It reopened later that day. A 58-year-old Chinese national, Jiamei Tian, was later found responsible for the vandalism. Following her arrest at the Washington National Cathedral, she was admitted to St. Elizabeths Hospital, a psychiatric facility, and was later found to be incompetent to stand trial; she has since been released from the hospital. On February 27, 2017, graffiti written in permanent marker was found at the memorial, the Washington Monument, the District of Columbia War Memorial, and the National World War II Memorial, saying \"Jackie shot JFK\", \"blood test is a lie\", as well as other claims. Street signs and utility boxes were also defaced. Authorities believed that a single person was responsible for all the vandalism. On August 15, 2017, graffiti that Reuters reported that \"Fuck law\" was spray painted in red on one of the columns. The initials \"M+E\" were etched on the same pillar. A \"mild, gel-type architectural paint stripper\" was used to remove the paint without damaging the memorial. However, the etching was deemed \"permanent damage.\" A Smithsonian Institution directional sign several blocks away was also defaced. On September 18, 2017, Nurtilek Bakirov from Kyrgyzstan was arrested when a police officer saw him vandalizing the Memorial at around 1:00 PM EDT. Bakirov used a penny to carve the letters \"HYPT MAEK\" in what appeared to Cyrillic letters into the fifth pillar on the north side. , police do not know what the words mean, although there is a possibility that they contain a reference to the vandal's name. Court documents indicate that the letters can not be completely removed, but could be polished at the cost of approximately $2,000. A conservator for the National Park Service said that the stone would weather over time, helping to obscure the letters, although she characterized it as \"permanent damage\". As one of the most prominent American monuments, the Lincoln Memorial is often featured in books, films, and television shows that take place in Washington; by 2003 it had appeared in over 60 films, and in 2009, Mark S. Reinhart compiled some short sketches of dozens of uses of the Memorial in film and television. Some examples of films include \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\", in a key scene where the statue and its inscription provide inspiration to freshman Senator Jefferson Smith, played by James Stewart \u2013 the Park Service did not want director Frank Capra to film at the Memorial, so he sent a large crew elsewhere as a distraction while a smaller crew filmed Stewart and Jean Arthur at the Memorial; \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\", a science fiction film in which the alien Klaatu visits the Memorial and is impressed by Lincoln's words carved there; the 2001 version of \"Planet of the Apes\"; \"\"; the 2011 film \"\", where Megatron destroys the statue of Lincoln and then sits on the chair as a throne; and the 2016 horror movie \"\", in which the Lincoln Memorial is shown with dead and burning bodies on the steps and the columns defaced with giant letters that spell out \"PURGE\", written in human blood. Other films and television programs which have featured the Memorial include \"In the Line of Fire\"; \"National Treasure\", in which the main characters discuss the possibility of stealing the Declaration of Independence while sitting on the steps of the Memorial; the comedy \"\", where the statue of Lincoln helps defeat the Horus warriors; the \"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\" episode of \"The Simpsons\"; the scene from \"Forrest Gump\", in which Forrest (Tom Hanks) delivers a speech standing on a podium in front of the Memorial facing the reflecting pool; and the 2013 film \"White House Down\", in which the President (Jamie Foxx) requests a fly-by of the Lincoln Memorial, at both the beginning and the end of the movie to pay homage to his hero. In \"The Handmaid's Tale\" (season 3, episode 6), June, the lead character, is seen standing in front of the statue of Lincoln, which has been desecrated. Many of the appearances of the Lincoln Memorial are actually digital visual effects, due to restrictive filming rules. As of 2017, according to the National Park Service, \"Filming/photography is prohibited above the white marble steps and the interior chamber of the Lincoln Memorial.\" Mitchell Newton-Matza said in 2016 that \"Reflecting its cherished place in the hearts of Americans, the Lincoln Memorial has often been featured prominently in popular culture, especially motion pictures.\" According to Tracey Gold Bennett, \"The majesty of the Lincoln Memorial is a big draw for film location scouts, producers, and directors because this landmark has appeared in a considerable number of films.\" Jay Sacher writes: From high to low, the memorial is cultural shorthand for both American ideals and 1960s radicalism. From Forrest Gump's Zelig-like insertion into anti-war rallies on the steps of the memorial, to the villainous Decepticon robots discarding the Lincoln statue and claiming it as a throne. ... The memorial's place in the culture is assured even as it is parodied. From 1959 (the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's birth) to 2008, the memorial, with statue visible through the columns, was depicted on the reverse of the United States one-cent coin, which since 1909 has depicted a bust of Lincoln on its front. The memorial has appeared on the back of the U.S. five-dollar bill since 1929. The front of the bill bears Lincoln's portrait.",

        "instruction": "Divide the following long text into well-structured, appropriately sized chapters.",
        "input": "A paddle steamer is a steamship or steamboat powered by a steam engine that drives paddle wheels to propel the craft through the water. In antiquity, paddle wheelers followed the development of poles, oars and sails, where the first uses were wheelers driven by animals or humans. In the early 19th century, paddle wheels were the predominant way of propulsion for steam-powered boats. In the late 19th century, paddle propulsion was largely superseded by the screw propeller and other marine propulsion systems that have a higher efficiency, especially in rough or open water. Paddle wheels continue to be used by small pedal-powered paddle boats and by some ships that operate tourist voyages. The latter are often powered by diesel engines. The paddle wheel is a large steel framework wheel. The outer edge of the wheel is fitted with numerous, regularly-spaced paddle blades (called \"floats\" or \"buckets\"). The bottom quarter or so of the wheel travels underwater. An engine rotates the paddle wheel in the water to produce thrust, forward or backward as required. More advanced paddle wheel designs feature \"feathering\" methods that keep each paddle blade closer to vertical while in the water to increase efficiency. The upper part of a paddle wheel is normally enclosed in a paddlebox to minimise splashing. There are two types of paddle wheel steamer, a \"sternwheeler\" with a single wheel on the rear, and a \"sidewheeler\" with one on each side. Both were used as riverboats in the United States. Some still operate for tourists, for example on the Mississippi River. Although the first sternwheelers were invented in Europe, they saw the most service in North America, especially on the Mississippi River. was built at Brownsville, Pennsylvania, in 1814 as an improvement over the less efficient side wheelers. The second sternwheeler built, \"Washington\" of 1816, had two decks and served as the prototype for all subsequent steamboats of the Mississippi, including those made famous in Mark Twain's book \"Life on the Mississippi\". Sidewheelers are used as riverboats and as coastal craft. Though the side wheels and enclosing \"sponsons\" make them wider than sternwheelers, they may be more maneuverable, since they can sometimes move the paddles at different speeds, and even in opposite directions. This extra maneuverability makes sidewheelers popular on the narrower, winding rivers of the Murray-Darling system in Australia, where a number still operate. European sidewheelers, such as , connect the wheels with solid drive shafts that limit maneuverability and give the craft a wide turning radius. Some were built with paddle clutches that disengage one or both paddles so they can turn independently. However, wisdom gained from early experience with sidewheelers deemed that they be operated with clutches out, or as solid shaft vessels. Crews noticed that as ships approached the dock, passengers moved to the side of the ship ready to disembark. The shift in weight, added to independent movements of the paddles, could lead to imbalance and potential capsizing. Paddle tugs were frequently operated with clutches in, as the lack of passengers aboard meant that independent paddle movement could be used safely and the added maneuverability exploited to the full. In a simple paddle wheel, where the paddles are fixed around the periphery, power is lost due to churning of the water as the paddles enter and leave the water surface. Ideally, the paddles should remain vertical while under water. This ideal can be approximated by use of levers and linkages connected to a fixed eccentric. The eccentric is fixed slightly forward of the main wheel centre. It is coupled to each paddle via a rod and lever. The geometry is designed such that the paddles are kept almost vertical for the short duration that they are in the water. The use of a paddle wheel in navigation appears for the first time in the mechanical treatise of the Roman engineer Vitruvius (\"De architectura\", X 9.5\u20137), where he describes multi-geared paddle wheels working as a ship odometer. The first mention of paddle wheels as a means of propulsion comes from the 4th\u20135th century military treatise \"De Rebus Bellicis\" (chapter XVII), where the anonymous Roman author describes an ox-driven paddle-wheel warship: The Italian physician Guido da Vigevano (c. 1280\u20131349), planning for a new crusade, made illustrations for a paddle boat that was propelled by manually turned compound cranks. One of the drawings of the Anonymous Author of the Hussite Wars shows a boat with a pair of paddle-wheels at each end turned by men operating compound cranks. The concept was improved by the Italian Roberto Valturio in 1463, who devised a boat with five sets, where the parallel cranks are all joined to a single power source by one connecting-rod, an idea adopted by his compatriot Francesco di Giorgio. In 1704, the French physicist Denis Papin constructed the first ship powered by his steam engine, mechanically linked to paddles. This made him the first to construct a steam-powered boat (or vehicle of any kind). Then he has poured the first steam cylinder of the world in the iron foundry Veckerhagen. In 1787 Patrick Miller of Dalswinton invented a double-hulled boat that was propelled on the Firth of Forth by men working a capstan that drove paddles on each side. One of the firsts functioning steamships, \"Palmip\u00e8de\", which was also the first paddle steamer, was built in France in 1774 by Marquis Claude de Jouffroy and his colleagues. The steamer with rotating paddles sailed on the Doubs River in June and July 1776. In 1783 a new paddle steamer by de Jouffroy, , successfully steamed up the river Sa\u00f4ne for fifteen minutes before the engine failed. Bureaucracy and the French Revolution thwarted further progress by de Jouffroy. The next successful attempt at a paddle-driven steam ship was by the Scottish engineer William Symington, who suggested steam power to Patrick Miller of Dalswinton. Experimental boats built in 1788 and 1789 worked successfully on Lochmaben Loch. In 1802, Symington built a barge-hauler, , for the Forth and Clyde Canal Company. It successfully hauled two 70-ton barges almost in 6\u00a0hours against a strong headwind on test in 1802. There was much enthusiasm, but some directors of the company were concerned about the banks of the canal being damaged by the wash from a powered vessel, and no more were ordered. While \"Charlotte Dundas\" was the first commercial paddle-steamer and steamboat, the first commercial \"success\" was possibly Robert Fulton's \"Clermont\" in New York, which went into commercial service in 1807 between New York City and Albany. Many other paddle-equipped river boats followed all around the world. In 1812, the first U.S. Mississippi River paddle steamer began operating out of New Orleans. By 1814, Captain Henry Shreve had developed a \"steamboat\" suitable for local conditions. Landings in New Orleans went from 21 in 1814 to 191 in 1819, and over 1,200 in 1833. The first sternwheeler was built by Mr. Roentgeres at Rotterdam, and used between Antwerp and Ghent in 1827. Team boats, paddle boats driven by horses, were used for ferries the United States from the 1820s\u20131850s, as they were economical and did not incur licensing costs imposed by the steam navigation monopoly. In the 1850s, they were replaced by steamboats. After the American Civil War, as the expanding railroads took many passengers, the traffic became primarily bulk cargoes. The largest, and one of the last, paddle steamers on the Mississippi was the sternwheeler \"Sprague\". Built in 1901, she pushed coal and petroleum until 1948. The first mention of a paddle-wheel ship from China is in the \"History of the Southern Dynasties\", compiled in the 7th century but describing the naval ships of the Liu Song Dynasty (420\u2013479) used by admiral Wang Zhen'e in his campaign against the Qiang in 418 AD. The ancient Chinese mathematician and astronomer Zu Chongzhi (429\u2013500) had a paddle-wheel ship built on the Xinting River (south of Nanjing) known as the \"thousand league boat\". When campaigning against Hou Jing in 552, the Liang Dynasty (502\u2013557) admiral Xu Shipu employed paddle-wheel boats called \"water-wheel boats\". At the siege of Liyang in 573, the admiral Huang Faqiu employed foot-treadle powered paddle-wheel boats. A successful paddle-wheel warship design was made in China by Prince Li Gao in 784 AD, during an imperial examination of the provinces by the Tang Dynasty (618\u2013907) emperor. The Chinese Song Dynasty (960\u20131279) issued the construction of many paddle-wheel ships for its standing navy, and according to the British biochemist, historian, and sinologist Joseph Needham: \"...between 1132 and 1183 (AD) a great number of treadmill-operated paddle-wheel craft, large and small, were built, including sternwheelers and ships with as many as 11 paddle-wheels a side,\". The standard Chinese term \"wheel ship\" was used by the Song period, whereas a litany of colorful terms were used to describe it beforehand. In the 12th century, the Song government used paddle-wheel ships \"en masse\" to defeat opposing armies of pirates armed with their own paddle-wheel ships. At the Battle of Caishi in 1161, paddle-wheelers were also used with great success against the Jin Dynasty (1115\u20131234) navy. The Chinese used the paddle-wheel ship even during the First Opium War (1839\u20131842) and for transport around the Pearl River during the early 20th century. The first seagoing trip of a paddle steamer was by the \"Albany\" in 1808. It steamed from the Hudson River along the coast to the Delaware River. This was purely for the purpose of moving a river-boat to a new market, but paddle-steamers began regular short coastal trips soon after. In 1816 Pierre Andriel, a French businessman, bought in London the paddle steamer \"Margery\" (later renamed \"Elise\") and made an eventful London-Le Havre-Paris crossing, encountering heavy weather on the way. He later operated his ship as a river packet on the Seine, between Paris and Le Havre. The first paddle-steamer to make a long ocean voyage crossing the Atlantic Ocean was , built in 1819 expressly for this service. \"Savannah\" set out for Liverpool on May 22, 1819, sighting Ireland after 23\u00a0days at sea. This was the first powered crossing of the Atlantic, although \"Savannah\" was built as a sailing ship with a steam auxiliary; she also carried a full rig of sail for when winds were favorable, being unable to complete the voyage under power alone. In 1822, Charles Napier's , the world's first iron ship, made the first direct steam crossing from London to Paris and the first seagoing voyage by an iron ship. In 1838, , a fairly small steam packet built for the Cork to London route, became the first vessel to cross the Atlantic under sustained steam power, beating Isambard Kingdom Brunel's much larger by a day. \"Great Western\", however, was actually built for the transatlantic trade, and so had sufficient coal for the passage; \"Sirius\" had to burn furniture and other items after running out of coal. \"Great Western\"s more successful crossing began the regular sailing of powered vessels across the Atlantic. was the first coastal steamship to operate in the Pacific Northwest of North America. Paddle steamers helped open Japan to the Western World in the mid-19th century. The largest paddle-steamer ever built was Brunel's , but it also had screw propulsion and sail rigging. It was long and weighed 32,000\u00a0tons, its paddlewheels being in diameter. In oceangoing service, paddle steamers became much less useful after the invention of the screw propeller, but they remained in use in coastal service and as river tugboats, thanks to their shallow draught and good maneuverability. The last crossing of the Atlantic by paddle steamer began on September 18, 1969, to conclude six months and nine days later. The steam paddle tug was never intended for oceangoing service, but was steamed from Newcastle to San Francisco. As the voyage was intended to be completed under power, the tug was rigged as steam propelled with a sail auxiliary. The transatlantic stage of the voyage was completed exactly 150 years after the voyage of \"Savannah\". Beginning in the 1820s, the British Royal Navy began building paddle-driven steam frigates and steam sloops. By 1850 these had become obsolete due to the development of the propeller \u2013 which was less vulnerable to cannon fire. However, paddle warships were used extensively by the Russian Navy during the Crimean War of 1853\u20131856, and by the United States Navy during the Mexican War of 1846\u20131848 and the American Civil War of 1861\u20131865. With the arrival of ironclad battleships from the late 1850s, the last remaining paddle frigates were decommissioned and sold into merchant-navy service by the 1870s. These included , which became one of the first Boston steamers in 1867. A few paddle steamers serve niche tourism needs as cruise boats on lakes and others, such as , still operate on the Mississippi River. In Oregon, several replica paddle steamers, which are non-steam-powered sternwheelers built in the 1980s and later, are operated for tourism purposes on the Columbia and Willamette Rivers. , built in 1912 as PS \"Seeandbee\", was the biggest passenger-carrying paddle steamer ever built, with a capacity for 6,000 passengers; it was converted to a training aircraft carrier during World War II. , also built in 1912 with a capacity for 6,000 passengers, operated on the Hudson River from 1913 until it was sunk in an accident in 1926. One of the last paddle steamers built in the U.S. was the dredge , built in 1934 and now a National Historic Landmark. The Shelburne Museum of Vermont features the paddle steamer , a preserved Lake Champlain ferry, which was transported overland to the museum after being retired from service in 1969, and is now open for tours. The ferries system in Toronto, Ontario, Canada operates , a paddle steamer originally built in 1910 and restored for operation since 1976. It is the last sidewheel-propelled vessel on the Great Lakes. Sister ships \"Bluebell\" and \"Mayflower\" became garbage scows and the former's hull is now a break wall in Toronto Harbour. The Elbe river Saxon Paddle Steamer Fleet in Dresden (known as \"White Fleet\"), Germany, is the oldest and biggest in the world, with around 700,000 passengers per year. The 1913-built \"Goethe\" was the last paddle steamer on the River Rhine. Previously the world's largest sidewheeler with a two-cylinder steam engine of , a length of and a height above water of , \"Goethe\" was converted to diesel-hydraulic power during the winter of 2008/09. Paddle wheelers are still in operation on some lakes in Southern Bavaria, such as \"Diessen\" () on Ammersee, built in 1908 and converted to a diesel system in 1975. It has been completely rebuilt in 2006. As paddle wheelers have proven to be such a great tourist attraction, a new one was even built in 2002 on Ammersee, \"Herrsching\", but it has never been powered by steam. On lake Chiemsee, RMS \"Ludwig Fessler\" () is still in regular service. It was built in 1926, but is now also powered by diesel engines (since 1973). The original diesel engine was the last ship engine being built by Maffei (no. 576). This engine has ended up in Switzerland to drive the newly renovated \"Neuch\u00e2tel\", launched in 2013. In Austria only a small paddle steamer fleet operates. There is \"Gisela\" from 1872 in Gmunden at the Traunsee, \"Kaiser Franz Josef I.\" from 1873 in St. Gilgen at the Lake Wolfgang, \"Hohentwiel\" from 1913 in Hard (near Bregenz) at the Lake Constance and \"Sch\u00f6nbrunn\" from 1912 in Linz at the Danube. In Italy, a small paddle steamer fleet operates on Lake Como and Lake Garda, primarily for tourists. has been operation with the same company since she was built in 1861. Sailing passengers to and from Silkeborg and Himmelbjerget ever since, using her original steam engine she was built with. is the oldest steamship in regular operation. Built in 1856, she still operates on lake Mj\u00f8sa in Norway. Switzerland has a large paddle steamer fleet, most of the \"Salon Steamer-type\" built by Sulzer in Winterthur or Escher-Wyss in Zurich. There are five active and one inactive on Lake Lucerne, two on Lake Zurich, and one each on Lake Brienz, Lake Thun and Lake Constance. Swiss company CGN operates a number of paddle steamers on Lake Geneva. Their fleet includes three converted to diesel electric power in the 1960s and five retaining steam. One, \"Montreux\", was reconverted in 2000 from diesel to an all-new steam engine. It is the world's first electronically remote-controlled steam engine and has operating costs similar to state-of-the-art diesels, while producing up to 90 percent less air pollution. Lakes of Biel, Morat and Neuch\u00e2tel (connected by channels): Lake Brienz: Lake Geneva: Lake Lucerne: Lake Thun: Lake Zurich: Note: The oldest active Swiss steamship is \"Greif\" (1895, on the Greifensee) with screw propulsion. No paddle ship is currently in operation in France as of 2015 (though some Paris sightseeing tourist crafts sport a dummy sternwheel powered by a hydraulic motor). In Lac D'Annecy an almost intact paddle steamer called la France, resting on an even keel, can be visited by advanced divers (resting at deep). She was built, like most of its Swiss counterparts by Escher-Wyss in 1909 (as a CKD dismantled kit to be transported by railway and assembled at the local annecy Puya Shipyard) and ran a regular line around Lac d'Annecy. During World War II the ship was laid up in Annecy and used as a prison by the German occupying forces and the Gestapo. \"La France\" made her last commercial voyage in 1965 and then fell into neglect and disrepair. Her owner had moored her some distance from the shore to save quay fees and she sprung an ice related leak and sunk in March 1971. It is a popular site among advanced divers (Level 2-assisted or 3-autonomous CMAS is requested to dive the wreck), an almost intact time capsule due to the fresh and low temperature water. Some divers even (mimic to) play underwater French billiard on the intact billiard table in the main lounge. Any hope of raising the ship is vain though: the hull was badly distorted when hitting the rocky lake bottom. , built in 1947, is the last seagoing paddle steamer in the world. This ship sails a full season of cruises from ports around Britain, and sailed across the English Channel to commemorate the sinking of her predecessor of 1899 at the 1940 Battle of Dunkirk. Based at Wareham, (one of the smallest passenger-carrying vessels of her type, with a passenger capacity of only 12) takes trips on the River Frome. \"Monarch\" is a side wheeler privately built at Chatham Historic Dockyard. In the River Dart (Devon) (a coal-fired river paddle steamer) operates short cruises from Dartmouth and trips between Dartmouth and Totnes at high tide. In the USSR, river paddle steamers of the type \"Iosif Stalin\" (project 373), later renamed s, were built until 1951. Between 1952 and 1959, ships of this type were built for the Soviet Union by \u00d3budai Haj\u00f3gy\u00e1r Budapest factory in Hungary. In total, 75 type \"Iosif Stalin\"/\"Ryazan\" sidewheelers were built. They are long and can carry up to 360 passengers. Few of them still remain in active service. Australia has a large collection of authentic and replica paddle steamers and paddle boats operating along the Murray and Darling Rivers, and in other areas around the country. Echuca/Moama has the largest fleet of paddle steamers in Australia, with 7 of them operating commercially and a large number of smaller privately owned vessels. PS \"Alexander Arbuthnot\" built 1923 at Koondrook, named after the former owner of the Arbuthnot Sawmills, works today as a tourist boat at the Port of Echuca. , built 1913 at Goolwa, is currently operating public cruises in Echuca. \"Canberra\" was built for the Conner family of Boundary Bend as their flagship fishing vessel, however has been in the tourism industry since 1944. , a replica steamer was built in 1982 at Barham, and operates a large range of cruises in Echuca \u2013 from 1 hour sightseeing trips to 3 night/4 day fully accommodated voyages. She is powered by an authentic steam engine, dating back to 1906. PS \"Melbourne\", built 1912, operates sightseeing cruises from Mildura. The replica paddle steamer was constructed in Gippsland, Australia, and launched in November 2008. PS \"Kookaburra Queen\" services the Brisbane River, operating as a floating restaurant or venue for hire. , which was built in Echuca in 1876\u201378, was used on the Murray River, the Darling River and the Murrumbidgee River in New South Wales. She was acquired by the National Museum of Australia in 1984, restored to full working order, and is now berthed as an exhibit outside the Museum at a wharf on the Acton Peninsula, Lake Burley Griffin, Canberra. PS \"Marion\", based at Mannum. The paddle wheeler \"Nepean Belle\" operates cruises on the Nepean River at Penrith, New South Wales. The restored paddle steamer is based in Wanganui, New Zealand. \"Waimarie\" was built in kitset form in Poplar, London in 1899, and originally operated on the Whanganui River under the name \"Aotea\". Later renamed, she remained in service until 1949. She sank at her moorings in 1952, and remained in the mud until raised by volunteers and restored to begin operations again in 2000. The 1907 \"Otunui Paddleboat\" operated on the Whanganui River until the 1940s in her original form as a tunnel screw riverboat. Lost from her mooring in a flood she was refloated in the late 1960s and rebuilt as a sternwheeled jetboat. Around 1982 she went overland to Lake Okataina and was converted to the sidepaddle vessel as she is today. Currently operating on the Wairoa River at Tauranga, this , diesel powered vessel with hydraulic drive for the paddlewheels offers scenic cruises and charters. \"Kapitein Kok\" is a paddle steamer built in 1911 for ferry service on the river Lek. It was fully restored in 1976 and is still in use today as a party ship. Queen Beatrix chartered the ship in 1998 as part of her 60th birthday celebrations. The paddle steamer \"De Majesteit\" was built in 1926. In 1958, a part of the movie \"G.I. Blues\" featuring Elvis Presley was shot on board of this ship. \"Michigan\" is a paddle wheeler built in 1982, for cruising on the Lake Biwa at Shiga. The name is from Michigan, a sister region of Shiga. is a preserved steam-powered sternwheel tug based in Portland, Oregon, that is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. The British Admiralty's Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service constructed a new \"Director\" class of diesel-electric paddle tugs as recently as 1957 and 1958. Each paddle wheel was driven by an individual electric motor, giving outstanding maneuverability. Paddle tugs were able to more easily make use of the inherent advantage of side wheel paddle propulsion, having the option to disconnect the clutches that connected the paddle drive shafts as one. This enabled them to turn one paddle ahead and one astern to turn and maneuver quickly.",
